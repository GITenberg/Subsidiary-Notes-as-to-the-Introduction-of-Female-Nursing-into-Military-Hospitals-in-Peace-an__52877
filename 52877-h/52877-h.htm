<h1 class="faux">SUBSIDIARY NOTES AS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF FEMALE NURSING INTO MILITARY HOSPITALS IN PEACE AND IN WAR.</h1>

<div class="transnote">
<h2 class="nopagebreak" title="">Transcriber’s Note</h2>

<p>There are three parts to this book, each starting with page 1.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been moved to the end of each part.</p>

<p>Variant spelling and inconsistent hyphenation are retained, a few
palpable printing errors have been corrected.</p>

<p>To make some tables easier to read on small screens some words have been repeated, for example each occurence of the word “idem” in the key of the <a href="#plan" title="">plan of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lariboisière</span> Hospital</a> has been replaced by the words it represents.</p>

<p>The key for the <a href="#plan" title="">plan of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lariboisière</span> Hospital</a> was originally
handwritten. No changes have been made to this for missing or
irregular use of accents or cedillas.</p>

<p>The <a href="#TABLES_OF_AGE_AND_DISTRIBUTION" title="">tables of numbers of nurses</a> near the end of the book were originally
printed in landscape, with some sideways printing. The columns and rows
have been swapped to make these tables easier to read on small screens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Definite
Objects: road
to them to be
found out.</div>

<p>1. It would appear desirable to consider that definite
objects are to be attained; and that the road leading to
them is to a large extent to be found out&mdash;therefore to
consider all plans and rules, for some time to come, as in
a great measure tentative and experimental.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Presumed
Main Object.</div>

<p>2. The main object I conceive to be, to improve
hospitals, by improving hospital-nursing; and to do this
by improving, or contributing towards the improvement,
of the class of hospital-nurses, whether nurses or head-nurses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Presumed
Intentions.</div>

<p>3. This I propose doing, not by founding a Religious
Order; but by training, systematizing, and morally improving
as far as may be permitted, that section of the
large class of women supporting themselves by labour, who
take to hospital-nursing for a livelihood,&mdash;by inducing,
in the long run, some such women to contemplate usefulness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2a" id="Page_2a">[2]</a></span>
and the service of God in the relief of man, as well
as maintenance, and by incorporating with both these
classes a certain proportion of gentlewomen who may think
fit to adopt this occupation without pay, but under the
same rules, and on the same strict footing of duty performed
under definite superiors. These two latter
elements, if efficient (if not, they would be mischievous
rather than useless), I consider would elevate and leaven
the mass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious
Orders.</div>

<p>4. It may or may not be desirable to incorporate into
the work, either temporarily or permanently, members of
Religious Orders, whether English or Roman Catholic,
or both, who may, with the consent of their Superiors,
enter hospitals nursed under the above system, upon the
definite understanding of entire obedience to secular
authorities in secular matters, and of abstinence from
proselytism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their
Advantages.</div>

<p>5. Great and undoubted advantages as to character,
decorum, order, absence of scandal, protection against
calumny, together with, generally speaking, security
for some amount of religious fear, love, and self-sacrifice,
are found in the system of female Religious Orders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Advantages of
Hired Labour.</div>

<p>6. On the other hand, the majority of women in all
European countries are, by God’s providence, compelled
to work for their bread, and are without vocation for
Orders.</p>

<p>In England the channels of female labour are few,
narrow, and over-crowded. In London and in all large
towns, there are accordingly a large number of women
who avowedly live by their shame; a larger number who
occupy a hideous border-land, working by day and sinning
by night; and a large number, whether larger or smaller
than the latter class is a doubtful problem, who preserve
their chastity, and struggle through their lives as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3a" id="Page_3a">[3]</a></span>can, on precarious work and insufficient wages. Vicious
propensities are in many cases the cause, remediless by
the efforts of others, of the two first classes: want of work,
insufficient wages, the absence of protection and restraint,
are the cause in many more.</p>

<p>Perhaps the work most needed now is rather to aim at
alleviating the misery, and lessening the opportunities and
the temptations to gross sin, of the many; than at promoting
the spiritual elevation of the few, always supposing
that this latter object is best effected in an Order.</p>

<p>At any rate, to promote the honest employment, the
decent maintenance and provision, to protect and to
restrain, to elevate in purifying, so far as may be permitted,
a number, more or less, of poor and virtuous women,
is a definite and large object of useful aim, whether success
be granted to it or not.</p>

<p>The Orders remain for the reception of those women
who either are or believe themselves drawn to enter them,
or who experience their need of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Main Object of
Hospitals:
Distinct
Functions of
Hospital
Clergy and
Hospital
Nurses.</div>

<p>7. The care of the sick is the main object of hospitals.
The care of their souls is the great province of the clergy
of hospitals. The care of their bodies is the duty of the
nurses. Possibly this duty might be better fulfilled by
religious nurses than by Sisters of any Order; because
the careful, skilful, and frequent performance of certain
coarse, servile, personal offices is of momentous consequence
in many forms of severe illness and severe injury,
and prudery, a thing which appears incidental, though
not necessarily so, to Female Orders, is adverse to or
incompatible with this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Objections to
Amalgamating
Members of
Orders with
Secular Nurses.</div>

<p>8. Grave and peculiar difficulties attend the incorporation
of members of Orders, especially of Roman Catholic
Orders, into the work. And, both with reference to the
Queen’s hospitals, and still more to the civil hospitals, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4a" id="Page_4a">[4]</a></span>humbly submit that much thought, and some consultation
with a few impartial and judicious men, should precede
the experiment of their introduction. This appears
to me one of the most important questions for decision.
Should it be decided in favor of their introduction, I trust
it may be resolved to do so only tentatively and experimentally.</p>

<p>I confess that, subject to correction or modification
from further experience or information, my belief, the
result of much anxious thought and actual experience, is,
that their introduction is certain to effect far more harm in
some ways than it can effect good in others; that a great
part of the advantages of the system of Orders is lost
when their members are partially incorporated in a secular,
and therefore, as they consider, an inferior system;
and that their incorporation, especially as regards the
Roman Catholic Sisters, will be a constant source of
confusion, of weakness, of disunion, and of mischief.</p>

<p>Saint Vincent de Paule well knew mankind, when he
imposed, amongst other things, the rule on the Sisters
of his Order never to join in any work of charity with the
Sisters of any other Order. This rule was mentioned to
me on an occasion which gave it weight, by the Superior
of the Sisters of Charity of one of the two Sardinian
Hospitals on the Heights of Balaklava, in the spring of
1856, and by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mère Générale</i> at Paris, October 1854,
when she was solicited by me, with the assent and sanction,
both of the English and of the French Governments, to
grant some of her Sisters to us at Scutari.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ladies</div>

<p>9. As regards ladies, not members of Orders, peculiar
difficulties attend their admission: yet their eventual
admixture to a certain extent in the work is an important
feature of it. Obedience, discipline, self-control,
work understood as work, hospital service as implying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5a" id="Page_5a">[5]</a></span>masters, civil and medical, and a mistress, what service
means, and abnegation of self, are things not always easy
to be learnt, understood, and faithfully acted upon, by
ladies. Yet they cannot fail in efficiency of service or
propriety of conduct&mdash;propriety is a large word&mdash;without
damaging the work, and degrading their element. Their
dismissal (like that of Sisters) must always be more
troublesome, if not more difficult than that of the other
nurses.</p>

<p>It might be better not to invite this element; to let it
come if it will learn, understand, and do what has to be
learnt, understood, and done: if not, it is better away.</p>

<p>It appears to me, but I may be quite mistaken, that,
in the beginning, many such persons will offer themselves,
but few persevere; that in time a sufficient number will
form an important element of the work; more is not
desirable.</p>

<p>It seems to me important that ladies, as such, should
have no separate status; but should be merged among
the head-nurses, by whatever name these are called.
Thus efficiency would be promoted, sundry things would
be checked, and the leaven would circulate.</p>

<p>There are many women, daughters and widows of the
middle classes, who would become valuable acquisitions to
the work, but whose circumstances would compel them
to find their maintenance in it. These persons would be
far more useful, less troublesome, would blend better and
more truly with women of the higher orders, who were in
the work, and would influence better and more easily the
other nurses, as head-nurses, than as ladies. Whether
or not the better judgment of others agrees with mine,
my meaning will be understood.</p>

<p>In truth the only lady in a hospital should be the chief
of the women, whether called Matron or Superintendent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6a" id="Page_6a">[6]</a></span>The efficiency of her office requires that she should rank
as a lady and an officer of the hospital. At the same time,
I think it important that every Matron and Superintendent,
(unless during war-service, when the rough-and-ready
life and work required will probably be best undergone by
women of a higher class) should be a person of the middle
classes, and if she requires and receives a salary, so much
the better. She will thus disarm one source of opposition
and jealousy, and enough will remain, inseparable from
her office.</p>

<p>The quasi-spiritual dignity of Sisters of Mercy is a
thing <i>sui generis</i>. But the real and faithful discharge
of the duties of the wards of a General Hospital, whether
with reference to superiors, companions, or patients, is
incompatible with the status, as such, of ladies. The real
dignity of a gentlewoman is a very high and unassailable
thing, which silently encompasses her from her birth to
her grave. Therefore, I can conceive no woman who
knows, either from information or from experience, what
hospital duties are, not feeling as strongly as I do, that
either the assertion or the reception of the status as such
of a lady, is against every rule and feeling of common
sense, of the propriety of things, and of her own dignity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion.</div>

<p>10. The question of the mode of Religion is an all-important
one, and the choice of a mode bears far more
directly upon this work than may, at first sight, appear.
To give up the common ground of membership of
the National Church is to give up a great source of
strength.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s
House.</div>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s House, if it steers clear of the rock of
prudery, undoubtedly possesses great advantages over a
system of hospital nursing by promiscuous instruments.
Not because it includes a Sisterhood, a system, in which I,
for one, humbly but entirely disbelieve; but because the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7a" id="Page_7a">[7]</a></span>laborious, servile, anxious, trying drudgery of real hospital
work (and to be anything but a nuisance it must ever
remain a very humble and very laborious drudgery),
requires, like every duty, if it is to be done aright, the fear
and love of God. And in practice, apart from theory, no
real union can ever be formed between sects. The work
now proposed, however, must essentially forbear to avail
itself of the bond of union of the National Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Only Women
of
Unblemished
Character
should be
employed.</div>

<p>11. None but women of unblemished character should
be suffered to enter the work, and any departure from
chastity should be visited with instant final dismission.
All applications on behalf of late inmates of penitentiaries,
reformatories, of all kinds and descriptions, should be
refused. The first offence of dishonesty, and, at the very
furthest, the third offence of drunkenness, should ensure
irreversible dismissal. No nurse dismissed, from whatever
cause, should be suffered to return.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Provision for
Old Age.</div>

<p>12. It is very important, if possible, to make provision
for the disabled age of deserving nurses. It does not seem
to me, I speak very diffidently, desirable to concentrate
them in one or more large buildings. I believe half the
inmates of half the alms-houses, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, are not on speaking
terms with each other. John Bull is of a peculiar idiosyncrasy:
nowhere are there such homes as in England,
but life in community does not seem congenial here. A
pension and the option of ending their days in solitary
quiet, or with some friend or relation, would probably
be the most comfortable arrangement for nurses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progressive
Increase of
Wages.</div>

<p>13. Many women are valuable as nurses, who are yet
unfit for promotion to head-nurses. It appears to me that
it would be very desirable to have an intermediate recompense:
say, after ten years’ good service, to raise nurses’
wages; after a second ten years, to raise them further.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fixed Age for
Admission and
Retirement.</div>

<p>14. There should be an age for the reception and for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8a" id="Page_8a">[8]</a></span>the retirement both of nurses and head-nurses. I think no
head-nurse should be under thirty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Simplicity of
Rules,
Definition of
Authorities.</div>

<p>15. Simplicity of rules, placing the nurses, in some
respects, absolutely under the Medical man, and, in others,
absolutely under the Female Superintendent, is very important;
also, at the outset, to have a clear and recorded
definition of these respective limits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Economy.</div>

<p>16. Economy is very important, with regard to the
eventual extension of the work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commencement:
Training.</div>

<p>17. In the event of the nurses not being trained in Her
Majesty’s service, advantage, it seems to me, would attend
their beginning in a great established hospital; unless
indeed it should be judged best to select and train a staff
of nurses first in a smaller and quieter one. Yet much
that would be unpleasant in the larger place would probably
be beneficial. The restraint, control, contact with
the masters, work, and order of things of a great and
settled place, would materially help with reference to the
nurses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Limits.</div>

<p>18. Common sense will assuredly make the fixed
resolve; both to fulfil one’s duty, and to keep within it.
It is as essential to do the latter as the former, and often
more difficult, especially for women; most especially for
hospital-nurses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Encumbrance
of Public
Support or
Patronage.</div>

<p>19. It appears to me most important to be free, once
and for ever, from the injurious, untrue, and derogatory
appendage of public patronage: what is called support
in these days always ends in patronage. This work,
truly understood, never has been, never will be, never can be,
a popular work; for many reasons, one of which is that the
public, of all orders, never can know anything of the real
nature of hospital-work. With the best intentions, it
will therefore make perpetual and impeding mistakes in
“supporting” or patronizing it. Its support and patronage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9a" id="Page_9a">[9]</a></span>are equally injurious in different ways as regards our
masters the medical men, ourselves the nurses, and people
who are neither medical men nor nurses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Caution, Non-expectation,
and Trust.</div>

<p>20. I end as I began. Let nothing be done rashly.
Let us not be fettered with many rules at first. Let us
take time to see how things work; what is found to answer
best; how the work proceeds; how far it pleases God to
accept and bless it. Let us be prepared, as I know well
we must be, for disappointments of every sort and kind.
What can any of us do in anything, what are any of us
meant to do in anything, but our duty, leaving the
event to God? His Will be done in earth, as it is in
Heaven.</p>

<h3 id="II1">II. <span class="smcap">Nurses in Civil Hospitals.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Isolation of
each Head
Nurse and her
Nurses.</div>

<p>1. The isolation of each head-nurse and her nurses
appears to me very important. The head-nurse should
be within reach and view of her ward both day and night.
Associating the nurses in large dormitories tends to corrupt
the good, and make the bad worse. Small airy rooms
contiguous to the ward are best. The ward should have
but one entrance, and the head-nurse’s room should be
close to it, so that neither nurse nor patient can leave, nor
any one enter the ward, without her knowledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All to Rank
and be Paid
alike, with
Progressive
Increase of
Wages.</div>

<p>2. All the nurses should rank and be paid alike, with
progressive increase of wages after each ten years’ good
service, or a slow annual rise, which is better.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Night Nurses.</div>

<p>3. The night-nurses should be on duty 12 hours, with
instant dismissal if found asleep; 8 hours should be allowed
for sleep, and 4 hours for daily exercise, private occupation,
or recreation. If they have no time to themselves for
their mending, making, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, they do it at night, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10a" id="Page_10a">[10]</a></span>
innocently, sometimes to the injury of the patients. I
would not however prohibit occupation at night; as sometimes
the ward-duty is slight; and doing something is
far better and more awakening than doing nothing. This
is one of the matters the head-nurse should constantly
look to. I do not fancy, but at present am not positive
about, cleaning or scrubbing at night. The night-nurse
should have a reversible lamp, or something that without
disturbing the patient, gives her light, brighter than the
dim fire or gas-light properly maintained in the wards at
night. She should have a room to herself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Day Nurses.</div>

<p>4. The day-nurses should have eight hours’ sleep, and if
it be possible, 4 hours daily for exercise, private occupation
or recreation. They may have one room.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nurses to
fetch nothing.</div>

<p>5. All provisions, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, should be as much as
possible brought into the wards, or to the ward-doors,
by lifts. Nothing should be fetched by the nurses. This
would save much time; would enable the nurses to do
more work, and yet have more leisure; and above all,
would obviate the great demoralization consequent on the
nurses, patients, and men-servants congregating in numbers
several times daily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Patients to
fetch nothing.</div>

<p>6. The patients should be made as useful as possible,
consistently with their capacities, inside the ward; but
should be permitted to fetch nothing to it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scrubbing.</div>

<p>7. I strongly incline to have the scrubbing done in each
ward, by a nurse assigned for that purpose, and for general
attendance when the scrubbing is done. There should be
hours for the scrubbing, before and after which it should
not be done. This whole matter is one on which I am not
positive at present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distribution of
Ward Work.</div>

<p>8. At present, I incline to something of the following
scale. Two wards, single are best, but it might be one
double ward, with 40 beds, served by 1 head-nurse and 3<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11a" id="Page_11a">[11]</a></span>
nurses. The head-nurse to superintend all things, and to
do the dressings not done by the surgeons and dressers,
assisted mainly by one nurse, whom she thus instructs in
nursing. Another nurse to do the scrubbing, and mainly
the cleaning, and when these are over to mind the ward
during the remaining hours in turn or in conjunction
with the first nurse. The third to be night-nurse. In
the morning, before dressing begins, and before the night-nurse
goes off duty, all three nurses to clean the ward,
make the beds, wash the helpless patients, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<div class="sidenote">Hours of
Dressing and
Poulticing,</div>

<p>9. Hours of morning and evening poulticing and
dressing to be fixed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and of
Medicine.</div>

<p>10. Hours of administration of medicine, always except
at night given by head-nurse, to be fixed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hours of
Exercise, and
Holidays.</div>

<p>11. Hours of exercise of head-nurse and nurses to be
fixed, and arranged with reference to the ward-duties.
A fixed occasional holiday given in turn to the nurses is
good. An annual longer holiday for them and for the
head-nurses is good; a fortnight is, I think, a good limit.
The holidays cause inconvenience, no doubt, but on the
whole do, I think, far more good than harm. The holidays
should be distributed in rotation during a fixed time of
year, and comprehended in two or three months, or four
at the very outside; and no woman declining her holiday
at the proper time should be allowed it at any other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Permission of
Matron for
extra time out.</div>

<p>12. No head-nurse or nurse should be out of the hospital
before or after the limit of her daily exercise time, two
hours, without written permission of the Matron. The
Matron, I think, should put the cause and amount of the
extension in writing, and report the same to the Treasurer
or Chief Officer, at the next general meeting, whenever it
is called, of the Officers of the Hospital. She will find
this a great protection against petitions. There is not a
doubt that the fewer extraordinary absences, the better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12a" id="Page_12a">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Place of
Exercise.</div>

<p>13. Were it possible to have a small garden (in college
gardens much effect and much refreshment is produced by
a green sward, a few trees, some shrubs, a fountain, and
some seats), in this, at strictly separated hours, the men-patients,
the women patients, the head-nurses and nurses,
the men-servants, if they choose, which perhaps is not
likely, could walk or sit down. This arrangement would
little interfere with its enjoyment by the dignitaries and
their children, who require it quite as much, and would be
found in its results practically and not poetically useful.
Hospitals are, and perhaps must be, in or near crowded
thoroughfares. Streets are miserable places to walk in
during great part of the year. Nurses want and unconsciously
crave for fresh air, and often half-an-hour is better
than more, given them close to their work&mdash;and away from
the streets, it would be often a great preservative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Caution.</div>

<p>14. I should, however, be very cautious as to introducing
music or anything of that sort. Hospitals are not
tea-gardens, nor homes, nor meant to be either. Great
quiet and some severity of discipline are necessary, and
ought to be exacted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dress.</div>

<p>15. I think the head-nurses should wear a regulation
dress, and the nurses another; if we adopt the honest
word livery, in use in the hospitals, it will perhaps do no
harm. Caps, dresses, aprons, should be prescribed:
whether or not out-of-door dress should be prescribed is
to be considered apart. Each should have three dresses
yearly. Better, I think, avoid washing stuffs; they require
endless change to look decent. Head-nurses and
nurses might wear the same dress, and some difference in
the cap would be quite distinction enough.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wages.</div>

<p>16. I incline towards giving the head-nurses <abbr title="50 pounds">£50</abbr>
a-year, one or two rooms (one room with an alcove and
curtain would be best), fuel and light. The nurses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13a" id="Page_13a">[13]</a></span>
lodging; the night-nurse a room to herself, the others
together; entire board, fuel, light, and good wages to be
decided upon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Furniture.</div>

<p>17. The nurses’ rooms should be supplied with plain comfortable
furniture. In the large Hospitals the head-nurse
furnishes her own room or rooms, which doubtless promotes
her comfort and her care of the furniture, both desirable
things; yet the tendency of many to accumulate decorations,
which take time to clean, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, is a drawback. I
should be inclined, as an experiment, to try the furnishing
plan, or at least to have some scale as to furniture allowed.
A bed, arm-chair, and sofa; a chest of drawers, wash-hand
table or shelf; book-case or shelves; a little table, and
a larger one, a couple of chairs, a footstool, and a cupboard
with broad shelves, are the utmost that can be
required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visitors.</div>

<p>18. A difficult and important point to settle is the
amount of liberty allowed as to receiving visits. It is
desirable on all accounts to make head-nurses and nurses
feel comfortable, and, as it were, at home: it is also better
they should not be unnecessarily out; also London distances
are great, and even omnibus-fare is a consideration;
also it is important to remember that these women are
apt to feel and say: “We are not in a nunnery,” nor
should they be. Still upon the whole, considering the
nuisance of ordinary visitors, and the greater nuisance of
extraordinary (<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, visitors to some head-nurses, kind
friends come to see how we are getting on, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>),
I think if it were possible to make the rule that no
visitors are allowed, it would be a great gain. I am not
sure, at present, whether it is possible or not&mdash;still less
whether it is possible to keep such a rule, if made. But,
at all events, nurses and head-nurses should only be permitted
to receive visitors on certain days and hours of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14a" id="Page_14a">[14]</a></span>
week; and those hours and days should be strictly kept to.
In Military Hospitals a still more rigid rule will be necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discharged
Patients.</div>

<p>19. No discharged patients, however previously well-conducted,
should be allowed to visit the wards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Graduated
scale of
Pensions.</div>

<p>20. Apart from raising the wages of good nurses after
every ten years’ service, I think it would well answer to
establish a graduated scale of pensions, for both head-nurses
and nurses; beginning with a small pension after
ten years’ good service, increasing every five years afterwards.
Many women are quickly worn out in this life;
and it is equally undesirable to turn faithful worn-out
servants adrift without any provision, or to retain them in
duties for which they are become unfit. It is a question
whether there should not be a compulsory stoppage from
wages, in order to entitle the nurses to pension under
conditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No occasional
Wards.</div>

<p>21. Have no occasional wards, or wards for accidental
and peculiar patients.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Head-Nurse to
each Ward.</div>

<p>22. Every ward, or set of wards, should be under a
head-nurse. Discipline is always defective under other
arrangements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious
Influence.</div>

<p>23. This turns greatly upon a previous question. Every
endeavour should be used to bring the women under
the influence of religion, God’s instrument for saving,
strengthening, and comforting souls. So far as this work
depends on rule, system, and superintendence, great
things may be done at any rate&mdash;so far as moral influence
is concerned, it can only be hoped for in the channels
appointed by Him who turneth all hearts whithersoever
He will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15a" id="Page_15a">[15]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="III1">III. <span class="smcap">Nurses in Her Majesty’s Hospitals.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Two kinds of
Hospital
Service for
Females.</div>

<p>1. If their introduction is eventually commanded by
the Queen’s Government, it will be advisable to consider
that their service admits of two distinct kinds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The one: its
Advantages;</div>

<p>2. “Their chief duties” may be “taking charge of the
linen and superintending the issue of extras.”</p>

<p>They will thus contribute materially to the comfort and
well-being of the sick; the real difficulties which undoubtedly
beset the introduction of women into ward
service will be avoided; and, an important consideration,
not lightly to be discarded, their exclusion from the ward
service will materially diminish the opposition of adverse
masters, some of whom are also unscrupulous masters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The other: its
Advantages.</div>

<p>3. On the other hand, I suppose, the experience of every
woman, admitted to ward service in hospitals where women
were not before, is that many lives are actually saved by
such admission, which would otherwise, humanly speaking,
be lost. In time of war some ciphers may be safely added
to the many. Any other great emergency, I suppose,
but do not speak from experience, would give the same result.</p>

<p>That the experience of many surgeons is identical, their
conduct has proved; no other testimony, under present
circumstances, can rationally be expected from them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Both to be
Weighed.</div>

<p>4. It is often right to begin with the smaller and less-opposed
good, and to introduce gradually, and, as it pleases
God, the remainder. It may be our duty to do this, as to
this matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Practical
Superiority of
the Second.</div>

<p>5. Practically, it is of little avail to superintend, ever
so carefully, the issue of extras to the sick, unless there
is permission and opportunity to pour the nourishment,
perhaps in continual drops, down the throat of reluctant
agony, or delirium, or stupor. And it is of little avail to
have this permission, unless there be also that of raising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16a" id="Page_16a">[16]</a></span>
the decent covering under which cholera, erysipelas, or
the oppression of long recumbency, or the discharging
wound, or the recent operation lie, and seeing to matters
within. It is a further question, whether the painful
cleansing of painful wounds, and the important minor
dressings, as poulticing, which things, generally speaking,
never have been done, and never will be done by surgeons,
are best left to nurses, orderlies, or the patients themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its real and
great
Difficulties.</div>

<p>6. At the same time, nothing is more pernicious than
to under-rate the objections of opponents. There is no
doubt that the admission of women to ward service is beset
with difficulties. These Naval and Military Hospitals are,
and must ever be, peculiar Hospitals, essentially different
in important details from the Civil Hospitals.</p>

<p>Sisters of Mercy, as regards the ward service, are decorous
and kind, and sometimes inefficient and prudish.
Nurses are careful, efficient, often decorous, and always
kind, sometimes drunken, sometimes unchaste.</p>

<p>Misconduct of women is far more pernicious in a Military
or Naval Hospital than in any other, as regards the
result of things&mdash;the crime is, of course, equally crime
everywhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condense
numbers as
much as
possible.</div>

<p>7. It appears to me desirable to simplify and condense,
as much as possible, female service in these Hospitals.
Let there be as few women, and these few as efficient and
as respectable as can be. Let all that can really be done
by men be so done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Only Head
Nurses.</div>

<p>8. Head-nurses are alone, I think, desirable to be
employed; I mean persons of the character, responsibility,
and efficiency, of head-nurses in other Hospitals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Classify the
Patients.</div>

<p>9. The patients should be distinctly classed, though,
of course, this is not the Female Superintendent’s business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17a" id="Page_17a">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many pros and cons to the formation of convalescent
wards.</p>

<p>It is a question whether convalescent or chronic patients
require female nurses at all.</p>

<p>Of such chronic cases, probably 100 would be efficiently
served by one nurse, having orderlies under her. Of
acute cases, probably, one nurse should take charge of not
more than fifty, possibly not more than forty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Qualification
of Nurses.</div>

<p>10. The nurses should be strong, active women, of not
less than thirty, nor, I think, more than sixty years of age,
of unblemished character, and should be irreversibly dismissed
for the first offence of unchastity, drunkenness,
or dishonesty, or proved impropriety of any kind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wages.</div>

<p>11. Their wages, I think, the same as those of head-nurses
in Civil Hospitals&mdash;certainly, not more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pensions.</div>

<p>12. Their pension on the same graduated scale.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rules.</div>

<p>13. Their rules should be simple, very definite, should
leave them at the absolute disposal of the surgeon as to
ward matters, and at the absolute disposal of the Female
Superintendent in all other matters. Their dress should
be uniform.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duties.</div>

<p>14. Their duties should be strictly defined, and be
consistent with the Code of Army Hospital Regulations,
the revision of which has been announced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Means of
Steadying
them.</div>

<p>15. Give them plenty to do, and great responsibility&mdash;two
effectual means of steadying women.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lodging.</div>

<p>16. The nurse’s lodging in view of her ward renders
her far more efficient; but this requires some special
arrangement. It would not do to have the chance of the
nurse’s being suddenly taken ill, with only patients and
orderlies within immediate reach. Were the nurses’ rooms
so arranged that two or more were on one floor (as is the
case in all Hospitals), and so arranged as to be entirely
separate, and yet, when so desired, easily accessible to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18a" id="Page_18a">[18]</a></span>
other, which might easily be contrived, this would probably
answer all purposes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Food.</div>

<p>17. Their food should be sent them cooked with some
slight variety. With the plainest intentions nature often
revolts from the perpetual joint of excellent meat in Hospital
air and life. The occasional “potage,” fish, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, of
other systems, are in fact, a refreshing and palatable
change. If, however, avoiding names that shock and
frighten, some slight change of diet could be contrived,
the effect would be good. This is practical and not at all
romantic, though it may look the latter.</p>

Military and Surgical Authorities before beginning, it
would be good.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Female Superintendent-General.</div>

<p>19. The Female Superintendent-General’s own powers
and responsibilities must be absolutely fixed, and so as not
to clash with those of the Officer (should such an Officer
be appointed, as has been elsewhere recommended), who
shall superintend the Hospital attendants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confidential
Reports.</div>

<p>20. Confidential reports must be so modified, as far as
women are concerned, that the humble boon granted to
pickpockets, of being informed of accusations laid to their
charge, must be extended to Her Majesty’s nurses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Permanency of
the System.</div>

<p>21. In framing the system and the Superintendent’s
own office, let it be attempted to secure the permanent
efficient working, please God, in ordinary hands. To aim
at the best conceivable may lead to failure. Genius works
with ordinary materials, but never constructs an edifice
which it alone can inhabit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quietness.</div>

<p>22. “In quietness and in confidence shall be your
strength.” Quietness has been from the beginning of its
publicity the one thing wanting in this work. I know the
fuss, which from its beginning surrounded it, was abhorrent
to us and was the act of others: but the work, which is all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19a" id="Page_19a">[19]</a></span>
we care for, has throughout suffered from it. It is equally
injurious and impeding as regards surgeons, nurses, and
people, who are neither. External help in this coarse,
repulsive, servile, noble work, for it is all these things, is
truly the reed which pierced the hand that leant upon it.
One hospital, naval, military, or civil, nursed well, and
gradually training a few nurses, would do more good to
the cause than an endless amount of meetings, testimonials,
pounds, and speeches, to say nothing of newspaper
puffings, which to-morrow might turn into revilings. This
never will, never can be a popular work. Few good ones
are, for few are without the stern fructifying element of
moral restraint and influence; and though the streams of
this are many, its source is one. Hearts are not touched
without Religion. Religion was not given us from above in
impressions and generalities, but in habits of thought and
action, in love of God and of mankind, carried into action.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Various
Systems of
Female
Nursing
compared.</div>

<p>A very short comparison will here be made between the
methods of Female Nursing in the Military Hospitals of</p>

<ul>
<li>Russia,</li>
<li>England,</li>
<li>France, and</li>
<li>Sardinia,</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">as exemplified in the last War.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French and
Sardinian
Hospital
Service.</div>

<p>To do this, a sketch must be partly repeated, which has
been already given, of the organic difference between the
Hospital Service of each nation.</p>

<p>The essential characteristic of the French is, the importance
given in the field to the Divisional Hospital
Service over the Regimental.</p>

<p>The Regimental Medical Service treats only those
ephemeral cases which are to be exempted from duty for
a day or two. Cases of wounds or disease likely to last
for a term of weeks are sent to the Divisional Ambulance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20a" id="Page_20a">[20]</a></span>
in the field; those, where disease may possibly last for
months, to the General Hospitals at the base of operations.</p>

<p>The Medical Service of the Sardinians closely resembles
the above in its formation. In the late War, their General
Ambulances were at Balaklava; their General Hospitals at
Jeni Koi on the Bosphorus. They had no Divisional or
Regimental Hospitals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English.</div>

<p>In our Army, as is well known, the Regiment establishes
its Regimental Hospital wherever it goes. Theoretically,
it is exclusively a Regimental system of
Hospitals; however much, practically, it breaks down.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Russian.</div>

<p>The Russian system can scarcely bear a comparison with
ours; because their Regiments are Divisions. They had
a regular system of transporting the sick and wounded
upon the North side of Sebastopol, then upon Mackenzie’s
Heights, then upon Bakschi-Serai, and lastly upon Simpheropol.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Female
Nurses.</div>

<p>The adaptation of Female Nursing to the different
systems in the</p>

<ul>
<li>French,</li>
<li>Sardinian,</li>
<li>Russian, and</li>
<li>English Armies</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">has now to be noticed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sardinian and
French
Female
Nurses.</div>

<p>The Sardinians had Sisters of Charity, both in the
General Ambulances in the Crimea, and in the General
Hospitals on the Bosphorus.</p>

<p>The principal duties of these admirable women appear
to have been the care of the linen and small stores, and
the cooking, much of which they did with their own hands,
for sick officers and men. These duties were admirably
performed. They appeared, besides, to have a certain
charge in the wards, the power of giving “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douceurs</i>,” the
administration of extras, the seeing to the cleanliness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21a" id="Page_21a">[21]</a></span>
beds and patients, and something more precise with
regard to sick Officers; but their duties seemed to be
somewhat undefined in their relation to the Infirmiers.
Whether the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sœur</span> or the Infirmier Major were in charge,
to see the duties about the patient properly executed,
was rather a problem.</p>

<p>This was still more the case in the French Hospitals,
where the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sœur</span>” in the wards appeared more of a
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">consolatrice</span>” and an administratrix of extras: although,
out of the wards, her admirable housekeeping, both in the
kitchen and the linen-store, was predominant.</p>

<p>The French “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sœurs</span>” were not admitted to the Divisional
Ambulances in the front: it was whispered, because
of the corruption of the French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Intendance</span>, upon whom
they tacitly exercised a very inconvenient “surveillance.”
They served in all the General Hospitals at Constantinople;
and to their admirable services, <span  lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Baudens,
Inspecteur-Général en Crimée</span>, has rendered an “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclatant
témoignage</i>” in his “<cite class="plain" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mission Médicale en Orient</cite>,” published
in the numbers of the “<cite class="plain" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue des Deux Mondes</cite>,”
of February 15, April 1, and June 1, 1857.</p>

<p>In these French Hospitals of Constantinople, the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sœurs</span>” appeared to do all the cooking for the sick
Officers and that of the extras for the men.</p>

<p>I do not think that, in either French or Sardinian
Hospitals, the care of bed-sores and such like, which can
only be done by women, was sufficiently given to the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sœurs</span>.”</p>

<p>I have heard complaints made of this kind both by
Officers and men; and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sœurs</span>,” both French and Sardinian,
have been to me to look at the way in which we
treated bed-sores, and to borrow air-pillows and water-beds.</p>

<p>There is such a difference however in different Hospitals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22a" id="Page_22a">[22]</a></span>
in time of war and of peace, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, that I would not be
understood to mean that any of these remarks apply
absolutely or generally, but only to Hospitals I have
seen.</p>

<p>It may be as well to mention that, talking of “French”
and “Sardinian” Sisters, they all come from one “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maison
Mère</span>,” that of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Filles de la Charité de S. Vincent
de Paule</span>,” at Paris. There is a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maison Succursale</span>,”
at Turin. But all are of the same Order, and under the
same head.</p>

<p>Let me mention <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sœur Cordero</span>, the excellent Superioress
of all the Sisters employed in the Sardinian Hospitals
of the war, with the warmest affection and respect. She
was a woman of high rank, of the most captivating
manners, but of the utmost simplicity of character, and
of unfailing devotion to right and to God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Russian.</div>

<p>It remains to mention the Russian system, which, as
regards the organization of the duties of the “Sisters,”
appeared to me by far the best I have known. I am at a
loss to conceive what is meant by the following sentence
in the Report by two of our Army Medical Officers on
the “Russian Medical Department,” presented to the
House of Commons. Speaking of the Sisters of Mercy,
who are generally widows of officers, it is said “their chief
duties appeared to be in taking charge of the linen and
superintending the issue of extras.” This is founded on
error of observation&mdash;as the Russian system seems to be
the only perfectly organized system of female attendance
in Military Hospitals, which was developed in the Crimean
War. In it, the Sister has charge of all that relates to
the bed-side of the patient; she receives the orders from
the Medical Officer, attends him in his rounds; he confers
with her afterwards; she even reports the “felchers” or
dressers, as also the orderlies, as far as regards their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23a" id="Page_23a">[23]</a></span>discharge of duties at the bed-side of the patient. The
orderlies are, of course, under the control of a Non-commissioned
Officer, in all that pertains to discipline,
clothing, meals, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> The “felchers” are under a superior
“felcher,” and under the Medical Officers.</p>

<p>There are female nurses, wives and widows of soldiers,
under the “Sisters,” who are generally, as has been
stated, widows of Officers.</p>

<p>This appears the nearest approach to good organization
I have met with.</p>

<p>But again I say there may be much difference among
the Russian Military Hospitals. I would not be considered
as laying down an absolute experience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English.</div>

<p>It has been said elsewhere what was the system or no
system pursued in the English Military Hospitals, as to
Female Nursing. It was a new thing, and no General
Order or Warrant was ever issued as to the duties of the
nurses. Many duties clearly devolved upon the Female
Superintendent-General, as she was afterwards called in
“General Orders,” which never should devolve upon her
again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proposed
Duties of
Female
Nurses in
Military
Hospitals.</div>

<p>But it may be now clearly enunciated what the duties
of Female Nurses should be, and many reasons will subsequently
be given why there never will be discipline in
Military Hospitals till they are as follow:</p>

<p>Women only of the character, efficiency, and responsibility
of Head Nurses in other Hospitals should be admitted
into Military ones. They should have charge and be
responsible for all that pertains to the bed-side of the
patient; for his cleanliness, and that of his linen, bed, and
utensils; for all the minor dressings, not performed by
Surgeons or Dressers; for the administration of medicines,
and of the meals; for the obedience of the patient
and orderlies to the orders of the Medical Officer. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24a" id="Page_24a">[24]</a></span>should receive the orders of the latter, and always attend
him in his visits.</p>

<p>Till the above is done by women, the same want of discipline,
now to be observed in Military Hospitals, and
often already noticed, will continue,&mdash;such is my firm
belief, the result of much experience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duties which
should be left
to men.</div>

<p>There will be abundance left for the Ward Master or
Serjeant to do in taking Military charge of the Hospital
and its inhabitants, in being Office Clerk, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
keeping the Admission books, making States, Returns,
Accounts, and other documents, without his being Head-Nurse,
without his superintending the Orderlies at the
bed-side, his administering medicines, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, which can only
be satisfactorily done by a woman. And, when done by
her, there will still be ample work for two men, where
one does now the work of three.</p>

<p>The first should do the Military part, the second should
compound, take charge of Medical and Surgical stores, of
Returns and Accounts connected with these; and, where
there is no Purveyor, of Purveyor’s and Barrack stores,
provisions, cooking, washing, diets, and extras, including
Returns and Accounts connected with these.</p>

<p>As it is, there is one Hospital Serjeant, who is Ward-Master,
Serjeant, Steward, Clerk, Dispenser, Purveyor’s
Clerk, and Head-Nurse&mdash;a kind of “Maître Jacques,” as
in Molière’s “Avare.”</p>

<p>One man cannot do all these things.</p>

<p>A Female should be the Head-Nurse&mdash;a Serjeant should
be the Serjeant and Clerk&mdash;a Ward-Master the Steward,
Dispenser, Ward-Master, and Purveyor’s Clerk.</p>

<p>And here I must deplore the confusion unavoidable in
these definitions of proposed duties, while we have no
separate system for Regimental and General Hospitals.</p>

<p>What Dr. Menzies declared, in his evidence as to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25a" id="Page_25a">[25]</a></span>General Hospitals at Scutari, is strictly true, and one
great cause of our failure at Scutari:&mdash;“I have followed
the general rules for Regimental Hospitals, so far as I
could.”</p>

<p>While Regimental Hospitals are what they are, females
never can be admitted there. On the other hand, if
General Hospitals be established, one happy consequence
will be that the cooking and washing will be taken out of
the hands of the Hospital Serjeant, and regularly organized,
it is hoped under a Captain-Superintendent of
Orderlies. All Purveyor’s and Barrack stores, that is,
Hospital stores and furniture will, it is hoped, fall under
the charge of a Steward; Medical and Surgical stores
under that of an Apothecary.</p>

<p>It will only remain to place a female Head-Nurse in
charge of all that concerns the bed-side of a patient, and
the duties of the Orderlies about the bed-side, and a
Ward-Master in charge of everything else belonging to
the Orderlies and Patients.</p>

<p>But, if it should be determined to retain everywhere
the old Regimental system, it is only just to add this
very strong testimony and appeal in favour of the old
Hospital Sergeant, who indeed deserves it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I may take this opportunity of stating my conviction that,
from the very arduous, constant, and responsible duties of the
Hospital Sergeant, and his influence for good or ill among the
non-commissioned officers and men of the regiment, it is particularly
required for the good of the service that he should be
put at least on the same footing in rank and pay as a first-class
staff sergeant. He ought to pass an examination by a Board of
Medical Officers as to his fitness for compounding medicines on
the same footing as a druggist in England. My Hospital Sergeant,
who has been eight years a sergeant, three of which as
Hospital Sergeant, receives at present 1<i><abbr title="shilling">s.</abbr></i> 10<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i> pay per diem, and
an allowance of 4<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i> per diem as Hospital Orderly; at the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26a" id="Page_26a">[26]</a></span>time that there are sergeants in the ranks of the regiment four
years junior to him as a non-commissioned officer who are
receiving 2<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i> 10<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i> pay per diem.</p>

<p>“My experience leads me to consider that the regimental
bandsmen are not, as a body, likely to be sufficiently strong or
able men for the duty of carrying the wounded to be consigned
to them.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Note in Regard to the Russian Nurses Employed
in the War-Hospitals of the Crimea.</span></h2>

<p>The Russian nurses, in the opinion of their Master, the
famous surgeon, Pirogoff, did other things besides what
the Army Medical Director-General told the House of
Commons they did. But it is to be observed&mdash;</p>

<p>In the first place, that much allowance is to be made
for the confusion incident to Scotch and Russian surgeons
talking French together, and going over many subjects in
a very short time.</p>

<p>And in the second, that very likely some extra confusion
arose in the minds of our Army Medical Officers from
the fact of two entirely different sets of women having
served in the Russian War Hospitals, viz.:</p>

<p>(1.) The Sisters of the Elevation of the Cross.</p>

<p>(2.) The “Frauen des Barmherzigen Wittwen Instituts,”
(mentioned in a very cold manner in pages 4, 26, and
implicitly, 27, of Professor Pirogoff’s pamphlet, “Die
Gemeinschaft der Schwestern zur Kreuz-erhöhung. Berlin:
1856”); who are those spoken of at <a href="#Page_22a" title="Page 22"><abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 22, 23,
above</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27a" id="Page_27a">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The Widows were so instituted, about forty years or
more ago, by Mary of Wirtemberg, during so many years
the venerated Empress-Mother. It is quite possible that in
the war-pressure their services proved rather nondescript,
they being neither sisters nor nurses, strictly speaking; or
perhaps the sole reason why Professor Pirogoff has not
one good word for them is, that they were not under his
orders.</p>

<p>The Sisters of the Elevation of the Cross were a body
of secular women, with a few Sisters of Mercy, formed by
the Grand Duchess Helena, and placed by her under the
orders of the famous civilian Surgeon Pirogoff, to whom
the supreme surgical command in Sevastopol was virtually
given. Several things are incidentally mentioned concerning
them in his pamphlet, quite inconsistent with the
constitution of an ordinary religious order.</p>

<p>One or two things in the pamphlet are incongruous
enough to English ideas:&mdash;the narrative given, however
simply and succinctly, of the performances of the sisters by
name, the publication of the Professor’s evident disagreement
with the first “Oberin,” or Superior, who served ten
months, (the second, whom he so highly praises, had only
served two when he wrote); the improvement, by which the
Sisters’ concerns were “sat upon” by the Comité of
Oberin, Chaplain, Doctor, and elder Sisters, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>But the division of Professor Pirogoff’s war-nurses into
three categories is a pregnant hint for future service, please
God we yield it. These three categories consisted of (1)
the “Verband-Schwestern,” or those who assisted the
Surgeon in the dressings, and the “Feld-scherer”
(Dresser) in preparing them. (2) The “Apothekerinnen,”
or those who were in charge of all medical appliances for
immediate use, and who superintended the “Feld-scherer”
(Dresser) in the administration of medicines. (3) The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28a" id="Page_28a">[28]</a></span>“Wirthinnen,” who looked after the diets, clean linen, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,
of the patients, and the order of the hospital. Each
“category” was responsible for carrying out the orders of
the medical officers. To every Hospital-<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Baracke</i> (hut)
was attached one sister of each of the above descriptions.</p>

<p>In ordinary service the less nurses know of each other’s
wards the better&mdash;in war service it is essential that as few
women should serve as many sick as possible; and it is
impossible to attempt assigning to each nurse the entire
supervision of a ward. I think the categories, modified,
of course, and adapted to the Queen’s service, might be
most useful.</p>

<p>Another point usefully proved by Professor Pirogoff’s
pamphlet is the extreme importance, if it be possible, of
placing the nurses clearly under the orders of the Principal
Medical Officer, though a further point is, if possible, to
be secured, viz., that of the Principal Medical Officer being
favourable to their service. As women they should be
entirely under the control of their female superior, yet the
Principal Medical Officer should have a certain clear
amount of power in ordering that Superior as to their
employment at particular stations and on particular services.</p>

<p>The <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Transport Abtheilung</i> of the Russian sisters seems
to have been an admirable, though very unpretending
service. We might take a useful hint from it. Three
Sisters accompanied the more numerous<a name="Anchor_1" id="Anchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a> convoys of Sick
Transport from Simpheropol to Perekop, and provided the
sick with tea, sugar, clean linen, medical and surgical
appliances, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, on the way.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span></p>

<h3 title="">Footnote:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#Anchor_1">[1]</a>
According to Professor Pirogoff sick were almost daily sent from Simpheropol
to Perekop. They could not, therefore, be always accompanied by
Sisters.</p></li>

Nursing into Military Hospitals in Peace and in

<p>It is, perhaps, advisable first to speak of some of those
difficulties met with in the War Hospitals of the East, in
order that such may be prevented for others who may in
future be Superintendents-General of Nurses in Military
Hospitals whether in peace or in war.</p>

<h3 title="">I.</h3>

<p>No one ought to undertake a matter of duty of this
kind without first obtaining the consent of the War Office to
five conditions.</p>

<p>1. That every month, each of her sub-Superintendents shall
furnish her with an abstract of the requisitions made by her
on the Purveyor, whether for Nurses’ consumption, or for that
of Patients, and that she furnish the War Office with an
abstract of these. It is then the part of the Purveyor to
disprove her accounts, instead of its being, as before, her part
to disprove his.</p>

<p>2. That it be made a point of honour, not of grace, with the
War Department, to submit to her any Report, confidential<a name="Anchor_2" id="Anchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a> or
otherwise, made concerning the Female Nursing Staff; a condition,
without which it would be impossible to have respectable
women in the Military Service.</p>

<p>3. That the powers of the Superintendent-General shall be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>strictly defined, and put in “General Orders” in the first place,
and not in the last, in order that there may not be the useless
and endless correspondence which there was in the first Superintendent-General’s
case (and for what?).</p>

<p>4. That the Superintendent-General have the power of communicating
directly with the War Department; and that her
Money-Accounts be sent in by her directly to that Department.</p>

<p>5. That it be made a point of honour that the Medical
Officers communicate to the Superintendent-General, or Local
Superintendent, any complaint they may have against the
Nurses for disobedience.</p>

<p>In March 1856 the following appeared in “General Orders.”
Had it but been seventeen months earlier how much it might
have saved!<a name="Anchor_3" id="Anchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a> The definition of the Superintendent-General’s
powers and duties, therein contained, is all that is wanted to
prevent irregularities disastrous to the Service.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">General Orders.</span></p>

<i>March 1856.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“It is notified, by order of the Secretary of State for War, that
Miss Nightingale is recognized by Her Majesty’s Government
as the General Superintendent of the Female Nursing
Establishment of the Military Hospitals of the Army. No lady,
sister, or nurse is to be transmitted from one Hospital to
another, or into any Hospital, without previous consultation
with her. Her instructions, however, require her to have the
approval of the Principal Medical Officer, in her exercise of the
responsibility thus vested in her.</p>

<h3 title="">II.<br /><i>Nurses.</i></h3>

<p>1. Our Nurses were of four sorts.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nuns.</li>
<li>Sisters (Anglican).</li>
<li>Ladies.</li>
<li>Nurses.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Nuns were received not as Nuns, but as Nurses.</p>

<p>Their (so called) training told sometimes against us; sometimes
for us. The same with the “Sisters” (Anglican).</p>

<p>The Ladies were useful, exactly in proportion as they approached
the professional, and not the dilettante, mode of thought.</p>

<p>A larger proportion of paid Nurses than of Ladies did
well, and this under circumstances of peculiar temptation. Paid
Nurses are always the most useful.</p>

<p>2. There should always be a proportion of Nurses in Army
Hospitals</p>

<ul>
<li>To preside in Extra Diet Kitchens,<a name="Anchor_4" id="Anchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a></li>

Military Hospitals, is as small as this would be; they undertake
even less duty than this: in Military Hospitals they do
much less than in Civil Hospitals.</p>

<p>Women in Military Hospitals should all be contracted servants,
whether Nuns, Ladies, or professional Nurses.</p>

<p>There should be a retiring pension to each woman.</p>

<p>3. Miss Nightingale took service on the ground of being
under the Principal Medical Officer, and, consequently, of not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>interfering with him.</p>

<p>There was no <i>imperium in imperio</i> in her case.</p>

<p>This exists in the case of the French “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sœurs de Charité</span>,”
and existed in individual instances among the “Sisters” under
Miss Nightingale; <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, they gave articles of diet, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, as from
Sisters, not in obedience to Medical orders. This was immediately
put a stop to by her. That the Medical Officer is sole
master of diets, is an axiom of medicine, and of common sense.</p>

<p>This involved our only <em>answering</em> the Extra Diet Rolls in
our kitchens; not originating either in quantity or quality.</p>

<p>Afterwards, although frequent were the insinuations that we
transgressed the above maxim, no evidence of the fact was
ever obtained, except the following, which is given <i>verbatim</i>
and <i>literatim</i>, as “put into Court” by a First Class Staff-Surgeon,
in charge of one of the divisions of the Barrack
Hospital, Scutari. He alleged “that the Nurses were in the
habit of giving diets without leave;” and when pressed for
the facts, produced the annexed statement in “W. J. Northcott’s”

<div class="sidenote">1. Lay down
distinctly the
communication
which is
to take place
between
Director-General
and
Superintendent-General,
and
(in war and
abroad)
Principal
Medical Officer
and Superintendent-General,
and
the qualified
subordination
of the latter.</div>

<p>1. In defining the office and duties of the Superintendent-General
of Nurses, her direct communication with, and qualified
subordination to, the Director-General of the Army Medical
Department, and, abroad and in war, with and to the Principal
Medical Officer of the district, or equivalent, must be very
exactly defined. If the formation and government of a body of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
women to serve in the Hospitals of the Army Medical Department,
and in these alone, is contemplated, the less the Director-General
and the Superintendent-General have to do with each
other, in matters of detail, the better, and the less chance of
collision. For very weighty moral and practical reasons, the
sole government of the women must belong to the Superintendent-General,
and to the Matrons, whom she delegates, and
who are themselves responsible and amenable to her. But it
will never <em>work</em> to introduce female service into the Army
Hospitals, and to leave the Director-General of the Army
Medical Department, which, like everything else in the Army, is
and must be a hierarchy, no other power in connection with it,
than to write and encourage confidential reports against it.
There ought to be a definition of the Superintendent-General’s
position as regards him, and also, as regards the Principal Medical
Officer of the district, abroad and in war. It is useless, and
would be dangerous to evade this; it ought to be deliberately
settled, and distinctly stated. In the “General Orders” of
March 1856, the Superintendent-General’s complete power
over the women, and qualified subordination to the Principal
Medical Officer, are well and definitively expressed.</p>

<p>It is impossible to appoint the work of the Nurses without
the concurrence of the Director-General. It does not do to
put a woman into a great ward, or several smaller wards, of
men, with several orderlies, without clearly defining her position
there. To put her under the orderlies would be to make
her being there at all much worse than useless; but she cannot
have assigned to her the responsibility of the ward or wards,
and consequently, authority over both orderlies and patients,
herself being responsible to the Surgeon and Matron, without
the concurrence of the Chief of the Army Medical Department.</p>

<p>Nor, without such concurrence, can the duties of the Nurses
be assigned. At this moment there are extant two sets of
Regulations&mdash;the old Army Hospital Regulations, and those
of 1855 made for the late Medical Staff Corps. In these
Regulations, both the former and the latter, every duty a
Nurse can discharge is assigned to different men. The
responsibility of the ward, the administration of diets and
medicines, the application of poultices, fomentations, leeches,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>enemas, and minor dressings, are all in so many words assigned
as the duties of Assistant-Surgeons, of Hospital-Serjeants, and
Orderlies; and of Assistant-Surgeons, of Ward-Masters and
Orderlies of the Medical Staff Corps. The Regulations in
general are being revised;&mdash;so much the better. But the new
body of Orderlies, announced in the “Gazette” as the Hospital
Corps, will, of course, receive rules from the Director-General;
and if these things are not settled with him, there will be contradictory
rules in operation, which will most materially thwart
the working of the Female Service.</p>

<p>We have ourselves experienced this, as to the administration of
medicines, which one Principal Medical Officer took away from
the Nurses, saying that it was the duty of the Assistant-Surgeons,
in which he was borne out by an existing Regulation.
And it would really seem as if this were the intention of the
said Regulation, for it is there laid down that the medicines are
to be administered twice-a-day, as if this were a property of
medicine.</p>

<p>The existence of these Regulations proved also a great
stumbling-block in the Castle Hospital, after the war-pressure
was over.</p>

<p>Unless the Director-General, and in war and abroad, the
Principal Medical Officer, are brought into regular communication
with the Superintendent-General of Nurses, by the Rules,
they will, at every inspection of Hospitals, revert to the procedure
of giving orders and making alterations, which in fact
amount to reprimands on the Superintendent-General, and on
her Matrons, through the medium of some Clerk or Orderly.
There should be, therefore, a distinct channel of communication
laid down between the Director-General, and in war and
abroad, the Principal Medical Officer and the Superintendent-General
of Nurses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Also
between
Principal
Medical Officer
and Matron,
Staff-Surgeons
and Matron,
Staff-Surgeons
and Nurses,
and the
qualified
subordination
of the Matron
and Nurses.</div>

<p>2. Also, and in the same way, there should be distinct rules
for direct communication between the Principal Medical Officer
of each Hospital, and the Matron, and between the Staff (or
equivalent) Surgeons of the Hospital, and the Matron; if not
also between these latter and the Nurses.</p>

<p>The constitution of a General Hospital is about to be organized
in England. In the large War Hospitals there was
the Principal Medical Officer, a Staff-Surgeon in charge o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>f each
Division, then the Assistant-Surgeon, who answered to what,
as is now proposed, is called the Prescribing Medical Officer of
the Wards. As regards the Matrons and Nurses, it must not
be proposed to ignore all but these Prescribing Medical Officers.
Certainly, it would never do to give the Superior Surgeons of
the Hospital no <em>say</em> as to the nursing. In 999 cases out of
1,000, the Superior and older Surgeon is the one who understands
and cares much the most about the men, and who, therefore,
in the long run, would more appreciate and be fairer to
Matrons and Nurses who did their duty by them. The Superior
and older Surgeons too, in general, have far more correct
ideas of the importance of discipline in a ward, and of the ways
of maintaining it, than the Assistant-Surgeons. Moreover, as
far as one can judge on a mysterious subject, generally speaking,
the older and Superior Surgeon is the honester man. He must
be brought into direct communication with the Matron; this
will effect good, and prevent mischief. So also let the Staff-Surgeon
of the Division, or equivalent, be placed in direct communication
with the Nurses of the wards of his Division; this
will effect good and prevent mischief. If the Nurse is to trust
to receiving the orders of the Staff-Surgeon, through the medium
of the Assistant-Surgeon, she will often find herself in a false
position.</p>

<p>3. Now, as to the introduction of Nurses into all General
Hospitals&mdash;this gets rid of many difficulties, but at a fearful
cost.</p>

<p>For years to come, the difficulty will be not to extend the
work, but to serve such Hospitals as must be undertaken, with
respectable and efficient women. The material has, in a great
degree, to be created; abundance of applications will be received&mdash;the
prospect of a pension alone will do that&mdash;but the
real choice will be very limited. In these Military Hospitals
each Nurse must be a Head Nurse, and a trustworthy woman.
Many a woman who will make a respectable and efficient
Assistant-Nurse under the eye of a vigilant Head-Nurse, will
not do at all when put in a military ward or wards, herself the
only woman, and Head-Nurse over the Orderlies. As a body,
the mass of Assistant-Nurses are too low in moral principle,
and too flighty in manner, to make any use of here. Supposing
all the Head-Nurses of the great Civil Hospitals<a name="Anchor_5" id="Anchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a> offered themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>there are perhaps not many who could be recommended
for a <em>Military</em> Hospital. Some, who are very highly to be
thought of, would never bear transplanting into the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>res dura et</i>
<em class="plain">servitii</em> <i>novitas</i></span> of the Army Hospitals. The class from which
the Head-Nurses are mainly drawn, tradesmen’s and servants’
widows, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, will volunteer in numbers, but, in the majority of
cases, intending only to lead the idle life of many a London
Head-Nurse&mdash;“mental, not manual labour”&mdash;“Superintendence”&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
standing by while the Orderlies do her work and
their own. The material has to be created. The rarest powers
can do nothing effective in this, in 3, 6, or 12 months. To lay
a solid foundation will take the patient, anxious labour of years.
To begin with one Hospital would have great advantages.
Netley, if it is proceeded with, might be the one, though, in
most respects, a Hospital in an ordinary vulgar seaport would
be far preferable. Then let the work gradually be extended.
It is much more to be feared that the line will be taken of
forcing prematurely than of opposing its extension. If it
is attempted to occupy all the General Hospitals at once, how
is the gratuitous repetition to be avoided of the inevitable
misfortune of Scutari, viz., that of beginning on a large scale,
with a number of strangers? It certainly should be left to the
Director-General to regulate the introduction of Nurses into
the General Hospitals&mdash;and there is far more reason to fear that
he, if unfavourable to the change, will hurry, than obstruct such
introduction; indeed it might be better to settle that matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
beforehand with the Secretary of State, letting the Director-General
be apprised of it, viz., that time is required to effect
the gradual introduction of the Female Service with which the
Superintendent-General has been charged.</p>

<p>To sum up. A rule must be introduced by which the
Director-General is brought into communication with the
Superintendent-General, and her qualified subordination to him
distinctly expressed. Let the Principal Medical Officer in war
also communicate directly with the Superintendent-General or
the person performing her functions in the War-Hospitals, and
her qualified subordination to him be distinctly expressed.
The same with each Principal Medical Officer of a Hospital,
and the Matron of that Hospital. No alteration in these
Regulations can, of course, be made without the consent of the
Secretary of State. In case the Director-General and Superintendent-General
finally differ as to any new arrangements,
the matter should be referred to the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The Superintendent-General should issue special regulations
for nurses, after conference with the Director-General, and
under the sanction of the Secretary of State; also, local regulations
for the Matrons with the consent of the Principal
Medical Officer and sanction of the Governor of any General
Hospital.</p>

<p>If the Matron differ with the Principal Medical Officer, the
decision should rest with the Governor of the Hospital.</p>

<h3 title="">IV.</h3>

<p>As to some miscellaneous considerations, of no small importance&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Roman-Catholic
Sisters?</div>

<p>1. It is necessary for a Superintendent-General to have
counted the cost, and to be prepared or not prepared to include
Roman Catholic Sisters among the Nurses. This will deprive
her of some valuable women; of one (speaking for the present
time,) who is invaluable; of many decorous, not very
useful women. The question is perhaps settled by the fact,
that where you have the Roman Catholic Sister, you cannot be
secure from the Roman Catholic Direction, with all its many
strings, and machinery of opposition. Abroad the cause of the
Roman Catholic Church is often the cause of religion; and the
Romish Priest serves both zealously at the same time, and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>a pure heart. In England, and in matters of England, the first
aim of the Direction is too often to damage what is not Roman,
and the second to promote what is Christian. Upon the
whole I must think Roman-Catholic Sisters are better out of,
than in, the Army Hospitals. It would be right to think well
over how far they could be entirely dispensed with, in the event
of having soon to undertake a War Service.</p>

<p>In the event of a decision being made to dispense altogether
with Roman Sisters, it would be as well to be prepared
(though we never can speculate on the tactics of the
Roman faction, and after what occurred during the Crimean
war, it may think it better to take things quietly) for a battle,
(<i>not</i> confined to the Army Medical Department,) for the production
of an Inspector-General’s letter assigning “reasons”
for preferring Nuns to secular Nurses, and for the delivery of
sundry opinions of similar purport, ranging from that line to
the one taken in the paper emanating from the Army Medical
Department, extolling the Russian Nurses, “who were all
Sisters of Mercy, and mostly widows of officers.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Anglican
Sisters?</div>

<p>2. The nature of the Service and Rules would, unless in war
service, perhaps exclude English “Sisters” from the Nurses.
They supplied us with some valuable women in the last war,
and their Lady-Superior behaved ever generously, loyally, and
well towards us.</p>

<p>The principle and detail of most sisterhoods render them
unsuited for admixture with the secular element; and the
comfortable belief into which the good women (of both
branches) practically, if not theoretically, settle, that secular
women are too bad to be mended or influenced, unfortunately
makes their usefulness among Nurses nearly null. It would
never do to unsettle any of the Sisters; but if it so happened
that any voluntarily offered to serve as bonâ fide Nurses, some
valuable individuals might thus be acquired; but this should
not at all be pressed.</p>

<p>It would certainly remove a difficulty in declining Roman
Catholic Sisters, if the rule should be to decline also English
Catholic Sisters, forming the Staff entirely of secular women.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Whom is
the Nurse to
summon in
case of
disorderliness
in the Ward?</div>

<p>3. In Civil Hospitals there are three distinct elements of
government. First, the Civil Authority; the chief being the
Treasurer, or the equivalent civilian, whose subordinate is called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>diversely Steward, Superintendent, House Governor; second,
the Physicians and Surgeons (duly represented, in case of
holidays or illness, by the Assistant Physicians or Surgeons),
Apothecary and House Surgeon; and third, the chief of the
Nurses&mdash;the Matron.</p>

<p>It requires of course temper, discretion, forbearance, and
fortunate circumstances which do not always happen, for these
authorities not to spend a portion of their time in quarrelling
with each other; but the ruts are old and deep, and the wheels
move on, though they often stick. The Civil Authority is a
very important element, especially when the chief is a man of
judgment and firmness, who keeps himself paramount over all,
and does not delegate all to his subordinate the Steward. The
Steward and the Matron generally find their duties disposed to
clash.</p>

<p>In some Hospitals the rules are inexplicit in assigning
power to the Matron over all the women. But this apart. The
Steward represents and wields the police of the Hospital. He
progresses through the wards, he perceives, or the Head Nurse
reports to him, something disorderly. He rectifies it (or not,
as the case and the man may be). She thus, over and above her
relation to the Matron, has to appeal to, and to account to, the
Steward.</p>

<p>This power of police and discipline, wielded by the Civil
Authority of the Hospital, is of immense moment in regulating
the good order of the Hospital; it acts in sundry important
ways which need not be particularized.</p>

<p>Now, in the case of Military Hospitals, there is one important
simplification of the business, which need not be enlarged
upon. All the patients are men. But there are two things
which do not simplify the machinery of the Military Hospital.
The attendants, in the plan proposed, are not (and cannot be) all
Nurses, under the Matron; nor all Orderlies, under an Officer;
there are Nurses under a Matron, and Orderlies under some
Officer; and there is no Civil element. The Doctors both prescribe,
and hitherto have governed. An Officer orders flogging,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; but the Doctors practically both prescribe, and hitherto
have governed. And a Military Hospital must, and should ever
remain, essentially different from a Civil Hospital; both
different in discipline and detail, and altogether a rougher and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>ruder place. It should never for a moment be forgotten that
the soldier is a very peculiar individual, old and stern as is his
trade. A regiment, if one thinks <em>into</em> it, is a curious thing.
The Hospital which receives these men when ill and wounded,
whether regimental or general, is, and ought to be, a
place essentially different in many things from the great
Civil Hospital. The moral standard of the patients of the
Military Hospital, their readiness to obey, their good feeling
to each other, are strikingly higher than in the Civil Hospital;
but the soldier is what, amidst all his faults, he has been made
by the habit and spirit of discipline, which has become an
instinct and a second nature, and which ennobles his own.
Relax discipline, and in proportion as you do so, there remains
of the soldier a being with as much or more of the brute than
the man.</p>

<p>Discipline then being the pivot upon which the good order
of all military things, Military Hospitals included, turns, it
follows, that if you set down a few women (they should not be
many) in a great Military Hospital, unless they can become
effectually incorporated into the general spirit of discipline of
the place, they will only injure themselves and the whole.</p>

<p>As women, the more entirely they are under the government
of the Matron, herself under the government of the Superintendent-General,
the better. As Ward Nurses, the more
entirely they are under the orders of their Surgeons, the better;
but they have not only to obey the Surgeons, they have to
enforce the Surgeons’ orders among the patients, and both for
so doing, and for the cleanliness, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, of the ward, they have to
give orders to the Orderlies.</p>

<p>In the case where a rule will work, by which, if the Nurse
has to complain of an Orderly, she reports the same to the
Matron, who lays the complaint before the chief of the
Orderlies (whatever may be fixed upon as his name); well
and good; but a more direct procedure will also be found
necessary.</p>

<p>Every firm and discreet woman (none other is fit for a
male ward, least of all for a military ward), will avoid collisions,
reports, and violent outbreaks in the ward as much as possible.
But still, every now and then these things will happen, and
though by all means to be avoided if possible, when they do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>come, they clear the ward-atmosphere like a storm, provided
the discipline be strict. Every now and then&mdash;and every
experienced Head Nurse will tell the same story&mdash;some disobedience,
slovenliness, truculence, or sly impudence, will arise
in the ward, and she will find she cannot put it down alone.
If she remain helplessly deprecating or scolding the men, her
position becomes at once an unseemly and a dangerous one,
as that of all contemned authority is. In such a case, in the
Civil Hospital, the Head Nurse goes straight, according to the
nature of the case, to the House Surgeon or to the Steward,
unless the visiting hour be at hand, and she judges it best to
refer to the Surgeon. Discretion is again here required, as in
everything in Hospitals; but between the Surgeon and the
Steward, a firm, discreet Head Nurse will generally get the
ringleader expelled, and two or three others, named or unnamed,
warned of a similar fate. After this sort of explosion, the
ward is quiet and orderly for months. The thing is seldom
done, but the patients know it can be done at any time, and
that it will be done, in such or such a contingency.</p>

<p>Now the soldier cannot be turned out of Hospital, and he
knows he cannot. It becomes the more important not to suffer
an hour’s relaxation of discipline there. If, therefore, such an
outbreak, either on the part of patients or orderlies, should
happen in a Military Hospital, the Nurse ought to be able to
summon at once the proper authority and afterwards to report
the whole to the Matron, but first to bring direct the proper
authority into the ward. Whether it be the Captain of Orderlies
or the Orderly Medical Officer, or, as in case of emergencies,
is generally preferable, the Staff-Surgeon himself, she ought
to have power at once to bring the proper authority into the
ward, to put down confusion and restore discipline at once, and
then afterwards to report to the Matron what has passed.</p>

<p>It must never be forgotten, that in every Regiment we must
calculate upon there being two or three thorough scoundrels,
five or six men who are not far off from being so, and an indeterminate
number whom discipline saves from ranking after
them. One year with another, characters no doubt as vile as
the worst that disgrace our gaols pass through the General
Hospitals.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>Another thing to be remembered is, that whatever classification
may be carried out, we may be certain beforehand that
numbers of patients from a vile cause will be in the ordinary
surgical wards of every General Hospital in time of peace.
Very severe cases of this sort give heavy work, and little
trouble. They suffer much generally, alike from disease and
treatment; are frightened, if not ashamed, about themselves;
and are generally extra-submissive and quiet. These cases,
however, generally would belong to the separated wards; which
latter contain usually a large admixture of patients who suffer
comparatively little, and who require to be dealt with with
unswerving firmness. For reasons somewhat too technical to
write, it is to be hoped, upon the whole, that female service will
not be, <em>at first, at all events</em>, extended to these wards. The
disgusting and comparatively painless secondary condition
will, I fear, find its way into the ordinary surgical wards, as
it does into the equivalent wards of every Civil Hospital.</p>

<p>All these things would increase the mistake of laying any
bar between the Staff Surgeon and the Nurse. In all matters
of discipline, generally speaking, the Staff Surgeon will give
much more support than the Assistant Surgeon.</p>

<p>A short definite rule should therefore be made, saying whom
the Nurse is to summon in the event of disorderliness in the
ward.</p>

<p>One thing more. There is nothing more dangerous than to
undervalue the objections of opponents. Let us give them their
full weight, and while firmly holding our course, and trusting
to God to guide it, draw useful cautions from the objections
which we quietly and steadily confront.</p>

<p>In the great Military Hospitals, of Roman-Catholic countries,
intelligent, well-behaved, Army Surgeons, while explaining
everything with thorough business-like precision, if spoken to
of the Paris Army Hospitals, before the recently introduced
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sœurs de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Vincent</span> served there, and asked what they think
upon the whole of the service of women in Army Hospitals&mdash;after
a little hesitation, and being urged to speak plainly, will
generally say that they prefer in Civil Hospitals the service
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sœurs</span> to those of hired nurses&mdash;but they deprecate
either Sisters or any women in Military Hospitals. 1.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Because the presence of women, however virtuous and guarded,
would excite passions and produce unfavourable results in many
cases. 2. Because they were unnecessary, the Orderlies being
efficient, faithful, kind, and sufficient.</p>

<p>Of the second reason one can judge nothing by a walk
through a hospital, as it does not always follow that what the
master says is enough is so&mdash;though this is one of the
mysteries it is good to know and not good to reveal. Of the
first there is no doubt. The question remains, striking
the balance of good and evil&mdash;Do chaste, guarded, and
efficient nurses on the whole contribute more to the economy
of human life, the order, cleanliness, and decency of a Military
Hospital than they do harm? Possibly the former effects are
usual and general; the latter exceptional and rare: after all,
most soldiers are men and not beasts. But it is well and necessary
to bear in mind both the existence of this danger, and the
exaggerated fears many Army Surgeons conscientiously as well
as unconscientiously have of it.</p>

<p>I therefore very earnestly hope that the work will not be
encumbered, at first at all events, with the charge of the venereal
wards. And it is most important, for the favourable result
of the anxious and difficult experiment about to be made, of
permanently introducing female service into Army Hospitals,
that we should be quite clear of the convalescent patients,
and should only attend patients severely ill or severely
injured.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. Pay and
Rations.</div>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Pay and Rations.</span>&mdash;In the great Civil Hospitals the
Head-Nurses have, on an average, 50<i><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></i> a-year, no board, an
allowance of fuel and light, and the use of one or two, generally
unfurnished, rooms. The Assistant-Nurses, on an average,
receive about 12<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i> a-week, [<abbr title="31 pounds">£31</abbr> per annum] no board, lodging,
with the use of some furniture, sometimes an allowance of fuel
and light, apart from the use of both in the wards.</p>

<p>Both Guy’s and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew’s Hospitals now give partial
board to the Assistant-Nurses, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s is about
to adopt the same plan.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s Hospital gives board to both Head and Assistant-Nurses.</p>

<p>In the last war Her Majesty’s Nurses received, on an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>average, 18<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i> a-week, lodging and board, fuel, light, and partial
clothing&mdash;18<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i> a-week is 46<i><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></i> 16<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i> yearly. Incorporated into
a permanent Service, and with a pension, they ought not to
receive the latter amount until after approved years of Service.</p>

<p>It is certainly a different thing to undertake service in a
Hospital in Smithfield or the Borough, and to undertake to
go, at a moment’s notice, to any part of the world. But the
Army Service involves this; and the pension it involves makes
a reasonable equivalent for the additional wear and tear of
climate, travel, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Going abroad is a regular part of the
Service undertaken.</p>

<p>Any artificial inducements should be avoided; at the same
time their condition should be made a comfortable one.
Wages, say 20<i><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></i>, rising to 50<i><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></i> a-year, rations, an allowance of
fuel and light, and a small furnished room, would be enough,
and not too much. To this should be added a fixed annual gift
of a few strong articles of regulation dress;<a name="Anchor_6" id="Anchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a> avoiding multiplicity,
and securing the things being all good of their kind. In
the last war they had too many things, and some were rubbish.
They ought to be well able to supply themselves with linen,
shoes, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, whether at home or when ordered abroad. The
articles to be given annually should be three strong dark
gowns, six strong aprons, six caps, six collars, one bonnet&mdash;and
let the things be good&mdash;biennially or triennially, one summer
and one winter cloak. In India, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, this might be modified.
Their room should be furnished, because, in removing to and
fro, it is better to release them from the cares and the pretences
of furniture; also, because, instead of many gimcracks,
you can thus furnish their rooms with a few comfortable,
strong, plain things, presenting a certain military simplicity,
which ought to pervade a Military Hospital.</p>

<p>Their wages abroad should not be increased. Whether they
serve at home or abroad concerns the Superintendent-General
alone, and is no merit or title for additional advantages on their
part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Shall Rations
be commutable
for Mess-money
in the
United
Kingdom?</div>

<p>If the principle of rations is considered preferable by the
War Department, it is important to give no extra trouble that
can be helped. If not, it is to be considered whether or not
it would be well to get rid of the rations, in the three kingdoms
at all events, for these reasons:</p>

<div class="sidenote">(1.) Because
such
commutation
allows greater
variety.</div>

<p>(1.) These women are Head-Nurses. They will think
themselves more comfortable “finding themselves” than
managing on the substantial and somewhat unvarying provisions
of the rations. Some take coffee rather than tea; some
tea rather than coffee; many would rather pay for white sugar
than not pay for brown. Considering the nature of nursing-work,
when faithfully done, it is better they should enjoy and
be refreshed by simple meals to their taste than by unpalatable
larger portions; especially if <em>the former can be done at no additional
cost or trouble to the Queen</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2.) Because it
averts
complaints.</div>

<p>(2.) You thus relieve the Superintendent and Matrons of
all communication with the department of the Purveyor-General;
of all the mistakes, accidental or otherwise, which
might occur; of all complaints of quantity or quality of provisions;
of amenities such as those experienced at Balaclava
General Hospital, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>Of five London Hospitals, the three endowed Hospitals pay
all their Head-Nurses in money, and give no board. (This is
strictly correct, although, to avoid a long unimportant detail, I
have simplified things in this paragraph, and in the two concerning
the pay of Head-Nurses and Nurses.) The London Hospital
gives its Head-Nurses wages, and a fixed quarterly payment
<i>vice</i> the rations of bread, meat, and vegetables, to which they are
by the rules entitled. This change was made not very long
ago, to end the frequent complaints of quantity, quality, and
price, made, perhaps with foundation, by the Nurses. The
Westminster Hospital paid its Head-Nurses partly in money,
partly in rations of cooked provisions, and there were repeated
and general complaints of the quality, quantity, and cooking
of the provisions issued to them.</p>

<p>It is therefore to be considered whether the simpler and
better plan be not to give the Nurses a fixed money payment,
and let them “find themselves,” unless the War Department
object to rations not being issued in part payment.</p>

<p>Abroad in many cases, in war in all cases, rations would be
desirable. A fixed calculation as to expense should be
made.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>Experience and consideration will probably give rise to the
following conclusion&mdash;except in war and in retired stations
abroad, not to have Rations; still less to let the Nurses
“find themselves,” for the following reasons:&mdash;(1.) It
is important that the Nurses should not have this excuse for
being absent from their duties&mdash;“that they have been to get
provisions.” (When absent, it should be in pursuit of health
and exercise.) (2.) If the Nurse is to cook for herself, greater
accommodation will be required than the <em>one</em> room recommended,
otherwise the necessary cleanliness cannot be observed.
To commute the Rations for mess-money, to put this mess-money
in charge of the Matron, wherever there is a market;
wherever there is none, to let her “<em>draw</em>” for such provisions
on her own indent, as she thinks best, upon the Purveyor, appears
to me the safest course. For with regard to this question
of dieting the Nurses it should never be forgotten that, in all
cases (how much more in those where great physical fatigue
and mental anxiety are involved) that principle is the best, if
such can be established, which settles diet with a view to producing
the highest physical efficiency. Variety and mode of
cooking are two essential elements in this. And there can be
no doubt that, if a Matron will take the trouble to consult the
tastes of her Nurses, together with the above conditions, a
better diet might be laid down than could be secured by leaving
them solely to their unassisted vagaries and ignorance of
what is really the best diet. Community of cooking also implies
economy. Also the Nurse ought not to be permitted to
starve herself, to save money. Her time is too valuable to
allow of her cooking her own dinner; but she should always
prepare her own breakfast and tea, when and of what she prefers
herself, if she feels inclined to do so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">If not
commutable,</div>

<p>Where, however, the system of rations must be adopted,
three ways remain of working it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">(1.) Shall the
Nurse cook
her own
Rations?</div>

<p>(1.) Let each Nurse receive, and cook her own rations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2.) Shall the
Matron cook
and send
them?</div>

<p>(2.) Let the rations be delivered <i>en masse</i> to the Matron,
who has them cooked, sending her proportion to each Nurse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(3.) Shall the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Matron have
each Nurse’s
Dinner cooked
for her, as she
likes best?</div>

<p>(3.) Let the Matron, requiring a small payment to cover
expenses, arrange that each Nurse can receive her dinner
cooked as she wishes it. There is something of this sort at the
London Hospital; where the Nurses (and Assistant Nurses)
have the right of sending their joint to be boiled or baked in
one of the kitchen stoves.</p>

<p>Of these different ways, the first would be liked best by the
women&mdash;a thing to be considered, in subordination, and as a
help to their respectability and their efficiency&mdash;still it is,
for some reasons stated above, objectionable. However,
in this, as in far more important things, it is essential to
consider everything as tentative and experimental for some
years to come. Do not be fettered by too many rules at first:
try different things, and see which answers best.</p>

<p>With regard to rations, it is as well to explain that there
were two ways of drawing them for the nurses during the war.
In some of the Crimean Hospitals, it was arranged that the
same ration should be drawn for a Nurse as that appointed by
Regulation for a Medical Staff Orderly. This answered, as may
be supposed, exceedingly ill. There was considerably more of
some articles, such as bread and meat, than the women could
eat; and the surplus had to be wasted or returned to the Purveyor&mdash;a
serious complication. Of some articles, such as tea
and sugar, there was as much too little; and these had to
be drawn as extras, except such as the Superintendent-General
found it easier and more simple, as she generally did, to provide
herself.</p>

<p>The other method was for the Local Superintendent to draw
daily on the Purveyor for such articles as she judged necessary;
and by thus drawing <i>en masse</i>, a considerable saving was, of
course, effected for the Queen, the tastes and health of women
were consulted, and there was no complication of accounts.</p>

<p>Where rations are to be drawn at all the latter method should
be always followed; and as the former might be understood by
the word “rations,” it would be better to call them by some
other name, as it must be obvious that such a method could
never answer for women.</p>

<p>The experiment which I should wish to try, by which greater
variety could be secured, but which could only be practised
where there was a market at hand, would be for a commutation
to be made of rations for money. Each nurse to supply
her quota of “mess money,” the “mess money” to be all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
expended on the “mess,” and the Matron to manage the “mess”
day by day, and arrange for the cooking to be done in common.
If each nurse’s dinner is to be cooked separately, it necessarily
entails great waste of nourishment. The Nurses would not
like this so well as “finding themselves,” but it would ensure
them a far better diet.<a name="Anchor_7" id="Anchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wages and
Mess-money
must be
distinct.</div>

<p>It would be a question whether the Queen should pay the
Superintendent-General so much for each Nurse’s wages, and
so much for board, the latter to be retained by the Superintendent-General,
or whether the Superintendent-General or
each Matron, with the Superintendent-General’s consent,
should arrange with the Nurses. This is important, as which
ever way it is settled, there must not be disputes between
Matron, Nurses, or still less Superintendent-General, as to
what amount of wages is to be allotted to the board, or what
savings can be effected in the coals, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>On the whole it would seem best for the Nurse’s pay to
be so much in money for herself, and so much in money for
food into the Superintendent-General’s hands. But the question
of how much is a serious business.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5. Washing,
how to be
done? Rule
to compel the
Nurses to <em>put
it out</em>.</div>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Washing.</span>&mdash;Except in war-emergencies, this must not be
suffered to be done by the Nurses, they must be compelled to
put it out. I would not trouble the Authorities about this;
the Nurses can afford it, and the more things are simplified the
better. In out-of-the-way districts, the Matron might
arrange with a laundress, the Nurses making a fair payment.
In war-emergencies, if possible, provide a strong washerwoman,
but this would have to be settled each case on its merits.
Except in emergencies they must not wash; it takes up far too
much time; it takes up strength which is wanted for other
things; and washing and drying either in wards or nurses’
rooms is unhealthy and objectionable. There must be a rule
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>as to this: some worthy souls would scrub at every rag, rather
than pay a few pence weekly. The Nurse ought, however, to
be compelled to have certain changes of linen weekly, which
some will not, if they pay for it themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6. Cleaning

or Ward-kitchen,
or

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Cleaning their own rooms.</span>&mdash;I well foresee sundry
difficulties in the little rooms at the entrance of their wards,
where I hope it will be managed to quarter the Nurses. But
there is no other way of fairly and really working a ward; and
I trust this plan will receive a fair trial. For efficiency, also
for comfort, it is most objectionable to make the Nurse sleep
at a distance from the patients. This is one of the points on
which theories, and the practical working of things, are very
divergent. It is an excellent thing when the Head-Nurse’s
room opens into the ward and when part of the upper part is
of glass, with a thick curtain, so that she can see into the ward,
without being seen. Let each Head-Nurse have a small room,
with a window opening into external air, with a curtain making
an alcove, behind which there should be a small iron bedstead,
with good bedding, and a washing table; and in the foreground
a table, a small one for meals, a chest of drawers, and a comfortable
arm-chair, two chairs, and I should add a sofa. Each room should
have a few shelves on the wall, and a large cupboard or small
closet with broad shelves, and space at the bottom to stow away
the Nurse’s box. Simplification and avoiding all trouble which
can be spared to the Departments are very important. I would
not therefore insist upon a little kitchen for the Nurses, nor
upon a very capital arrangement in some of the Sisters’ rooms
in Guy’s Hospital, where, behind a decent little door <em>in</em> the
sitting-room, there is a sink, with water laid on, a little safe for
meat, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, at top, and a complete little apparatus of the very few
utensils required for cooking one woman’s meals; so that a
Nurse can cook and wash-up, in her own room, without carrying
things out of it. This is much better than a kitchen, if the
Nurse is to cook her own meals; but, as above stated, I would
rather she did not. One room, with a curtain making an alcove,
is much better than two. The Queen is saved fuel; the Nurse is
saved cleaning two rooms; and if fuel is only issued for one, she
sleeps in a warm room, instead of one where there never is a fire,
and where her things get damp and spoiled. Often, where Head-nurses
have two rooms, one is built without a fire-place. Condense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>and simplify all things&mdash;one great object is to form a
body of useful hard-working women, of simple self-helping
habits. Two Nurses’ rooms should be together, but separate.
Sudden illness might occur, and the two women should be at
each other’s summons. The Quartermaster-General <em>must</em> grant
a <em>cabinet</em> between the two: this is <em>must</em>, not <em>may</em>. The Superintendent-General
must see to this herself, at first at all events:
there <em>is</em> a singular obtuseness in the small officials, by whom
these things are managed: if not overlooked, they will be sure
to put the construction in a particularly awkward, exposed place.
These things do enter into an Englishwoman’s daily comfort or
misery&mdash;it is worth arranging them decently in the first
instance.</p>

<p>Now as to the cleaning of these rooms. Head Nurses
generally are far too much disposed to make servants of their
nurses; put orderlies for nurses, and this objectionable tendency
would be a hundred-fold more objectionable. The Matron
must make it an absolute rule, that the only thing an orderly
does for a nurse is to carry her box in and out on the two grand
occasions of her entering and leaving the Hospital. The one
thing which in a Civil Hospital, an Assistant Nurse should be
allowed to do for the Head Nurse, is the cleaning her fire-place,
a thing done in a few minutes, and with satisfaction, by women
who have done it all their lives; but a dirty tedious messing
business to those who have not. But never mind: the orderly
must never enter the Nurse’s room: she must do it, and learn
to do it. The prosaic little business of black-lead, ashes, and
mess lying on the threshold of the work will do good rather
than harm. And even black-lead is unnecessary, as a varnish
now obtainable looks better. The orderly must never enter the
Nurse’s room&mdash;a <i>sine quâ non</i>. The Nurses should have, at
their choice, a carpet, not nailed down, or none. In either
case the room will require scrubbing, once a week if no carpet,
(which is best and cleanest in Hospital life), seldomer, if carpet.
Now the Nurses should not be required to scrub their own rooms&mdash;it
is useless waste of strength&mdash;it makes their hands coarse
and hard, and less able to attend to the delicate manipulation
which they may be called upon to execute&mdash;and with all the
<em>nursing proper</em> which ought to fall upon them, and not upon
the orderlies, their time can be better occupied than in cleaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>their own rooms. Also, while trying to keep clear, on the
one hand, of the tribe of “fine ladies,” it will be possible, on
the other, if such menial offices are to be performed, to fall into
the opposite mistake and to fail in obtaining the class of women
desirable to fill such important trusts. Let the Matron consent
to a charwoman, soldier’s wife, or some one person named and
defined, and found, to be paid by the Head Nurse, to come for the
two hours, which, at furthest, this business will take. It would
be well worth while for the Matron to look out and provide
two or three strong women to do this, by fixed rotation&mdash;each
Nurse making a fair payment&mdash;and to ascertain that they are in
and out of the Hospital by a particular hour, so as to prevent
these external persons doing other things than scrubbing. But
do not trouble the Departments as to this&mdash;the more things are
simplified, and the fewer expenses are in connection with the
Nurses, by far the better.</p>

<p>Take the trouble to see that a tidy useful fire-place is in
each Nurse’s one room. Some fire-places will consume thrice
the fuel of one which can do ten times more work. A compact
useful little fire-place, to burn as little fuel, and do as much
business (in a very small way) as possible, is a thing of daily
use, economy, and comfort.</p>

<p>The nurse should not do anything of her own in the ward,
or the ward or orderlies’ scullery, if there is such a place.
This is a matter requiring some decision.</p>

<p>8. With regard to the Matrons, though as Locke says of
tutors, there are all kinds of persons to be found, it is certain
the right persons are not always found; and these officers will
take time to find, at the outset especially. Let them be (if it
be possible) of the middle class; if it be possible, middle aged,
active women, widows of officers or army surgeons. A vast
deal of struggle is ever going on in professional life; a vast
deal of silent, decorous misery ever follows on the premature
deaths, the compelled early retirements, the sundry chances
and changes which ever abound in the army of England. So
far as it goes, and <i>cæteris paribus</i>, it would be right, just,
and expedient to give a preference for these matronships to
widows of officers and army surgeons. Try to secure thorough
principle, sense, activity, and steady discreet ways; never mind a
little vulgarity of manner; that the different orders should have
their indefinable perpetual distinctions of manner as of other
things, is perhaps for a long time to come in the essence of
things. Two or three women of the stamp of the Matrons of
a few of our Civil Hospitals would be very valuable. If the
Matron do not get tired of what, unless one keeps one’s
secret thoughts fixed on the meaning and the end of all things,
is coarse, thankless, up-hill work enough&mdash;she will in the
course of years accomplish great good. But she must have
principle, sense, heart, and a firm cheerful mind. She must be
not under thirty and, if possible, not over forty, on appointment.
Should her being without children be made a <i>sine
quâ non</i>? Children&mdash;poor little things&mdash;are wanted nowhere
in the way of business, but do not be too strict about
this: they are sometimes pledges to other things than fortune&mdash;thoughts,
anxieties, and labours for them, concentrate and
steady a mother’s heart&mdash;there will be fewer adventurers.
Maternal <em>nurses</em> must upon the whole be discouraged,
because upon the whole the disadvantages seem to overweigh
the advantages.<a name="Anchor_9" id="Anchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a> But the Matron’s office and duties are different;
she is not fixed to a great ward of patients; and
her having children should not be a bar, especially if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
did not live with her. Young and grown-up daughters are
much in a Matron’s way; sons matter much less.</p>

<p>The greatest Civil Hospital gives its Matron 200<i><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></i> and a <em>house</em>,
the other great Hospitals, 150<i><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></i>, and a <em>house</em>. The London
Hospital gives 150<i><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></i>, and a couple of good well-furnished
rooms, and a servant. A <em>house</em> is an impediment to a Matron’s
duty. She is seen arriving in the wards, and she is more or
less hindered in entering them. From her rooms she issues
and re-issues, unexpectedly, and much more efficiently. 200<i><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></i>
and quarters is not at all too much.</p>

<p>The Matron must be responsible for the storing, mending, and
distribution of the linen, and for returning to the laundry any
linen not properly washed or dried. Linen ought never to be
dried in the wards, a process both inconvenient and unwholesome.
The Matron ought to have a steady, respectable woman, certainly
not below the rank and pay of a nurse, to be responsible to, and
under her, for the linen, otherwise the proper care of the linen will
take up far too much of her time. This is important. If, however,
a Nurse should be thus set aside for the Laundry, she must not
be allowed to enter the wards; otherwise she will unconsciously
become a gossip and mischief-maker. I would term
her “Linen Nurse,” not Assistant. The Matron should
also have a steady, properly paid servant. A Matron of
the proper sort has quite other things to do at a leisure
moment, than to keep her wardrobe in order. She must
have a servant; but it seems to be advisable to simplify
things, and condense payments as much as possible; and I
would rather consider this in the salary, and let the Matron
find and pay her own servant. Try to have the servant’s room
near the Matron’s. These minutiæ, once provided for, enter
much into the daily working and comfort of things.</p>

<p>The dress of the Matrons is a difficult thing to settle. Sometimes
a Matron is afflicted with a taste for either gorgeous or
elegant apparel, which the Nurses are invariably proud of, admire
and humbly emulate. This sort of thing would be really out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>place in a Military Hospital, and would moreover sadly discompose
the Nurses with their plain caps and gowns. How would
it be to allow the Matrons the choice between a Regulation
dress and a plain black or brown silk gown?</p>

<p>It will take much thought to decide whether the Matrons
should all be paid alike, or whether climate and size of Hospital
enter into this. On the one hand they undertake a service,
of which almost the first regulation very properly is, that they
undertake to go to all parts of the world as soon as sent; on
the other hand, certainly some climates wear health and life
much quicker than at home.</p>

<p>The Matrons out of the three kingdoms have increased
responsibility, and can do more mischief, if incompetent or
untrustworthy.</p>

<p>If the Matron has increased pay abroad, it would not do
not to augment that of the Nurses. This is an important
matter; and as it is on all accounts necessary that Matrons
and Nurses should on their engagement thoroughly understand
the nature of the service they undertake and, of course, a
serious part of the service is that it involves sudden and long
removals, it would be necessary to define upon what terms
they go abroad. Yet it never would do, for reasons which
will readily be perceived, to make the foreign stations objects
of desire to Matrons and Nurses. These stations will always
be so far the most anxious, that they will always be the most
removed from the Superintendent-General’s inspection and
immediate rectification of anything that goes wrong. They will
also be, in various ways, the most trying to Nurses. The rules
once settled, every Matron and Nurse refusing to go abroad
when ordered, ought at once to be discharged, and to forfeit
all re-admittance into the service and all pensions. On the
whole, I think the Matrons should all be paid alike. But
inasmuch as foreign service necessitates more wear and
tear to the constitution, one year should count as equal
to two years of service for pension, in case of disability.
The same should be made applicable to the Nurses. As the
advantage is distant, it would, in a great measure, do away
with any desire for foreign service.</p>

<p>Volunteering for foreign or war-serv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>ice must be the exception&mdash;careful
selection the rule. The “adventurers” will
be generally ready to volunteer, and it would be too much to
hope that we shall always, perhaps ever, be entirely free from
that tribe; the most we can hope is soon to discover and get
rid of them. Foreign stations will never do for an untried
Matron or Nurse. At the same time it is most desirable not
to change the Executive officers of any Hospital more than
can be avoided.</p>

<p>But let there not be too many rules at first; see how things
work, and take one step at a time.</p>

<p>The selection of exclusively middle-class Matrons seems to
be important.<a name="Anchor_10" id="Anchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a> Their order will disarm one source of opposition
and jealousy; plenty more will remain, inseparable from
the work; but it is good to get this out of the way.</p>

<p>The name of Matron is the same as in Civil Hospitals. In
many respects the office and duties are different: <i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, the
Matron in Military Hospitals must exercise a far more constant
supervision in the wards. But this will require great discretion
on her part. It is the practice of most Civil Hospitals
for the Matron never to enter the wards till the Nurse’s
dressings are over. It would be advantageous to modify this.
But, at the same time, the Matron must understand Hospital
Nursing, or she may make very serious mistakes in either
reprimanding or directing the Nurse as to technical matters.
She must be a person who knows herself what she has to see
that others know; or she will get herself, with or without the
Nurse, into very injurious errors. There is much in a name;
and, in some respects, that of Superintendent would better
denote her office, as regards the Nurses, would add to her
authority, which is desirable, and would point her out as acting
under the Superintendent-General.</p>

<p>Incorporate among the Nurses whatever women of the
higher orders may be admitted into the Service at first. If
inefficient and unfit they are far better altogether eliminated.
If thoroughly efficient as Ward Nurses, if thoroughly obedient
and respectful to the Matron, if they have sense and heart to
gradually leaven, not coldly withdraw from occasional companionship
with the other Nurses, they will, in the course of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>time, effect quietly a great deal of good.</p>

<p>There should be some Rule of this kind&mdash;</p>

<p>Any Matron or Nurse who may receive permission to serve
Her Majesty without pay shall be, in all respects, bound by and
amenable to the Regulations on pain of dismissal from the service,
without permission of re-entering it.</p>

<p>If this cannot be done, money can easily be returned in one
shape or other; but it would have a good moral effect
on the Nurses to allow of the admixture of unpaid Nurses, provided
they are strictly bound by the same Regulations, and
distinguished by no sort of peculiar designation.</p>

<p>The Surgeons will dislike these unpaid Nurses; but, in the long
run a firm, discreet woman, <em>who is an efficient Nurse</em>, can get on
with any Surgeon <em>who has his sick at heart</em>. The Matron also will
not at all like them, at first, but will find that she can rely upon
them and that they quietly and effectually help her with the other
Nurses: and, if she has her heart in her work, she will end by
being just, though, perhaps, always a little extra strict with
and jealous of them. The other Nurses will have, at the first,
a strong little touch of republicanism towards them, which will
gradually wear off, and, with God’s help, a higher and truer
moral tone, and a simpler and more useful kind of habits
among them will prevail, than would otherwise be the case.
As for the patients, with all their faults, trust them&mdash;trust the
English soldier, and the peasantry from which he springs. What
these poor fellows are we know, and need not discuss. They
are worth suffering a good deal for; please God in the long run
good will be done. If only we can keep clear of the false,
pernicious, and derogatory system of puffery and fuss which
others, for their own purposes, and from vague, silly good-feeling
have wound around this work&mdash;a work essentially unpopular
the moment we come to details! We have learnt what
reality is and what its presence or absence in this business
imports. As for the many and great other difficulties of the
work, they must be appreciated, they need not be dreaded. The
purpose is a good and noble one, and God grant it success!
All we have to do is, to do our utmost, and leave the event to
Him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">9. Nurses&mdash;begin
with few
at first.</div>

<p>9. As for the Nurses the material must be formed. If
a few respectable soldiers’ widows, including, and all the
better, non-commissioned officers’ widows, could be found,
<i>cæteris paribus</i>, a preference should be given to widows
of the Service.</p>

<p>Except in emergencies Nurses should not be taken under
thirty, or above forty<a name="Anchor_11" id="Anchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a> years of age. These women are Head
Nurses. Most of the Civil Hospitals take no Head Nurse
after forty.</p>

<p>One caution in engaging Nurses is perhaps not sufficiently
attended to. Certificates, without personal inquiry and answers
to distinct questions, are not worth the paper on which they
are written.</p>

<p>As to engaging any Nurses out of the great Hospitals, for
sundry reasons, this should be done as little as may be.</p>

<p>Let us begin, for the sake of God and this His work, with
few women. Extension is easy&mdash;to occupy too much ground
at first would be, I do in my conscience believe, an irretrievable
mistake.</p>

<p>No unnecessary Nurses should be suffered in Hospital; and
no Nurse in charge of wards should be required to do needlework
for the Hospital. There should be no superfluous hands;
and the less a Nurse enters another’s ward the better.</p>

<p>In case of suspension of a Nurse for misconduct, temporary
assistance must, however, be obtained; and this might be either
appointing another Nurse, to do, for the time, such duty in the
suspended ward as she could do in addition to her own, or
putting in a temporary substitute.</p>

<p>All such dislocation of the Service, necessary and useful for
emergencies and holidays, should, nevertheless, be made to
take place as seldom as may be.</p>

<p>No Nurse, during her suspension, should be allowed to enter
any ward of the hospital.</p>

<p>Any Nurse asking or accepting a present, whether in money
or in kind, from any patient, or friend of any patient, whether
during his illness or after his death, recovery, or depar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>ture,
must be at once suspended from duty, her pay immediately
cease, and the Superintendent-General be apprised of it, who,
if satisfied of the truth of the charge, should immediately
dismiss her.</p>

<p>Two hours daily for exercise or recreation should be allotted
to the Nurses, during which two hours they are to be considered
relieved of the responsibility of their wards. But I would
not be too absolute in requiring them to go out: sometimes to
lie down or sit still for an hour or two will do more good than
a walk. Give them two hours for optional exercise. Head-Nurses
cannot have more of fixed leisure. They must get
time for private occupation as they can: very often not at all;
and no Nurse fit for her place will, of course, in emergent
states of her ward, leave it. Also the Matron must not worry
herself or them, if an anxious Nurse sits up part of a night or
a whole night with bad cases.</p>

<p>To a certain degree the Matron will find it better to allow a
little liberty and choice, in the matter of times and hours,
(always excepting after proper hours, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, after dark) to
the Nurses, who are Head-Nurses, than to attempt making
them mere machines. An uniform system, as far as possible,
and a little range to each, will answer best. But do not hurry
the uniform system too much; take time: this is very
important.</p>

<p>The Nurse should, every morning, at an hour to be fixed by
the Chaplain or Matron, read aloud in the ward, the Confession,
the Lord’s Prayer, the Collect for the Week, the Collect
for Grace, and the Benediction; and every evening, at an hour
to be fixed by the Chaplain or Matron, she should read aloud
in the ward the Confession, the Lord’s Prayer, the Thanksgiving,
the Collect for Aid, and the Benediction.<a name="Anchor_12" id="Anchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a> This
would Christianize things, instead of heathenizing them;
and I believe not a soldier would dream that his conscience
was injured by it. The Roman Catholics and
Presbyterians might be allowed quite to refrain, if they
chose, which they would not. It would be necessary for the
Chaplain-General to approve of and direct in this, and best to
wait a year or two before beginning it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The prayers should be very short, the whole not more than
five or six minutes each time, and the Nurse should read them,
the men joining at the proper times.</p>

<p>In some Civil Hospitals the prayers are far too long and are
gabbled over by some patient, perhaps the worst character and
the best scholar in the ward, or are stumbled through by some
little boy, upon whom the others cast the distasteful office, with
circumstances of irreverence, partly unintentional and partly
shocking. At <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew’s Hospital the very short
morning and the very short evening prayers are printed clearly
on each side of a card, which is affixed to each bed; and each
morning and evening the Head-Nurse reads them aloud: the
difference is very great.</p>

<div class="sidenote">10. Have the
Diets sent hot
and ready-divided
from
the Kitchen.</div>

<p>10. The Colney-Hatch Lunatic Asylum has a diet system
worth inquiring into; nothing is fetched by the Nurse, the
Medical Officer writes the diets on a large slate which is ready
for him outside the ward.</p>

<p>The great advantage of this seems to be, that the Nurse’s
time is set free from a good deal of arithmetic and some writing;
also that each man’s portion is served him <em>hot</em> from the kitchen,
not cut up laboriously by the Nurse. In most Hospitals the
Nurse cuts and divides the diets; in the London Hospital she
moreover weighs them. All this takes a great deal of time.
If the patients can get the divided portions <em>hot</em> from the
kitchen, it is far preferable.</p>

<p>At <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Hospital the portions are sent hot and
divided from the kitchen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11. The less
any Patient is
made into an
Orderly by the
Surgeon the
better.
The Nurse

Regulations
to invoke to

<p>11. It should be distinctly settled by whom poulticing,
fomenting, and all minor dressings, applying leeches and
blisters, and giving enemas,<a name="Anchor_13" id="Anchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a> are to be done.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>It would be advisable to consider whether the Nurse ought
not to instruct the Orderlies in some things. This, if it did not
clash with Orderlies’ Rules, would make these men, especially
those ordered for foreign service, much more useful than they
are now, without such teaching.</p>

<p>It will, however, be essential that there should be no clashing
between the Nurses’ Regulations and those already or to be
issued to the Orderlies. And for this, among other reasons, it
is essential to establish a direct channel of communication
between the Director-General and Superintendent-General of
Nurses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ward Medical
Officer to give
Directions to
Nurse.</div>

<p>I think, upon the whole and with reference to preventing,
as far as rules can do it, the obstruction of the Nurse’s duty,
by adverse or inexperienced Medical Officers giving orders to
Ward or Assistant Ward-Master, Orderlies, or patients, instead
of to her, that it is better to charge him to give the Nurse
his orders as to the sick.</p>

<p>All the above-mentioned things should be done by the
Nurse, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, by her habitually and as a rule; occasionally
letting an orderly do them, under her own eye, in order that he
may learn, as well by doing them sometimes himself as by often
seeing her.</p>

<p>The reasons why all these things must be clearly settled
beforehand are these:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Adverse Medical Officers will make all use of counter-regulations.</p>

<p>II. Medical Officers who give fair play will find it impossible
to settle the matter, if, on ordering, <i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, leeches, the Orderly
shows Rule so and so by which he does it, and the Nurse Rule
so and so by which she does it. The existence of the old regulations
and the arrival of the new ones, about the Medical Staff
Orderlies, were made great use of against our work, by some of
the Medical Officers, after the heavy pressure of the war was
over. So, at Scutari, a Principal Medical Officer took away
and would not restore the practice of the nurses giving medicines,
in which he was borne out by an existing rule. Contradictory
rules are miserable things.</p>

<p>Unless the Matron’s authority is supported by the Principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>Medical Officer the Patients always suffer. The Nurse is the
only proper person to be responsible for the directions of the
Medical Officers being carried out in a General Hospital.</p>

<p>III. It will enable the Matron to stop all nonsensical prudery,
on the part of the nurses, and to require that they should
do what they undertake to do, and not pass off to an Orderly,
still less to a patient, the duties they should discharge themselves.</p>

<p>As a general rule there is a good deal of this false modesty
on the part of Nurses, especially of Head Nurses. In individual
cases it is a serious thing to shake even false ideas of decorum:
in laying down general Rules it is the more important to lay
down as duties what are such. Suppose an application of what
the French call “la petite chirurgie” ordered. The Head Nurse
“never dreams of doing such things.” The Nurse, following
her superior’s false shame of duty, transfers the business to an
ignorant patient. In some cases great harm has arisen thereby
to the Patient. In other cases, but not the majority, after
such an order given, the Head Nurse goes quietly to the bed,
draws the curtain round it, and makes the application
herself&mdash;saying “she always did that herself, as it was a
business requiring care, as the patient was often disposed to
resist, and as she was thus certain that it was properly and
effectively done.” I have always admired and respected such
women; but they are not the majority. Very often patients
are allowed or left to do things for themselves, which they
cannot do properly, or when they ought not to be trusted to
inflict the pain on themselves which doing things properly often
causes.</p>

<p>The practice of allowing some particular patient to become a
sort of half orderly in the ward, letting him always attend some
particular case, or give general help in severe cases, is most
reprehensible. It is never allowed, whether in Civil or
in Military Hospitals, without very bad consequences to the
discipline of the ward. Where extra help, in lifting, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, is
required, let the Nurse require the most convalescent of the
patients to help, but let her carefully refrain from selecting any
patient or allowing any patient to put himself forward, as a
regular help or quasi-Orderly. As an almost invariable rule it
will be found that the less patients do for each other the better
for themselves, and for the discipline and the good feeling of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>the ward. Let them be made useful in the wards, as far as
possible, in such lighter cleaning, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, as a patient can properly
do (here, again, discretion is required, or a lazy Orderly
will lay undue burdens on a willing patient); but the less they
do for each other undoubtedly the better for all parties. I
would not, however, expressly exempt the patients from being
made useful in nursing the sick. A lazy or ill-conditioned
patient might make it a handle to refuse to do or grumble at doing
things which he ought to do, such as (a thing frequently
required) giving and emptying a bed-pan to an ordinary
patient who cannot leave his bed, while the Nurse and Orderlies
are doing other things in the ward; assisting to move a
helpless patient, if all the Orderlies are not at hand; sometimes
watching or attending for an hour or so a critical case, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> What the Superintendent-General and all Superintendents
must be especially vigilant against is selecting any
particular patient or allowing a willing patient constantly or
often to do these things, and to become a quasi-Orderly to the
ward or to any patient in it.</p>

<p>Assistant-Surgeons, partly from inexperience and partly from
spite, sometimes make this sort of quasi-Orderly of a patient.
The Nurse should have the power of respectfully saying, in
such a case, “The Regulations order me to do so and so, sir:
I beg you to let me do my duty.”</p>

<p>It is an important and should be, if possible, an invariable rule
that no discharged patient is ever to enter any ward. Soldiers
are, in many respects, on a different footing, as to each other,
from Civil patients. The above provision is perhaps rendered
thereby (not the less, but) the more important for the good
order of the ward. Still this, desirable in (and the rule in
several) Civil Hospitals, might be considered by Military as well
as Medical Officers to interfere too much with the feeling of
comradeship which, in its measure, is so essential a part of the
soldier’s very peculiar condition. The following rules however
might, at all events, be carried out. Some of them are actually
in the “Hospital Regulations.”</p>

<p>As quietness is indispensable in Hospitals, every duty should
be performed with the least possible noise, more especially at
night. Every patient must be in bed by 8 o’clock in winter,
and 9 in summer; and no conversation must be permitted after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>that time. Patients should be made useful in the wards, as far
as possible; but should fetch nothing into them. And no discharged
patient should be permitted to enter any ward, except
in the fixed visiting hours. The Governor, where there is a
Governor, or the Principal Medical Officer, will fix the visiting
hours; which shall not be more than two hours during each of
three days of the week. [Take proper advice as to whether this
maximum is too short. It is fully enough for Civil Hospitals, but
Military Hospitals are in sundry respects essentially different.]</p>

<p>In the discipline of all Military Hospitals, besides the prohibition
of all swearing and foul language included in the
Articles of War, is included the non-admission, or if by oversight
admitted among visitors, the immediate expulsion of all
disorderly persons. (Query&mdash;whether not to specify prostitutes.)</p>

<p>I very much wish that Hospital Sentries in General Hospitals
might keep out all visitors, except in the fixed visiting hours.
And I very much wish that a stringent rule were made as to
female visitors, both in Regimental and in General Hospitals.
Proper Military as well as Medical advice should be taken on
this point. It might not do to exclude them altogether; and,
if soldiers’ wives come, it might be better to admit also all
respectable-looking women, for it would be useless attempting
defining as to sisters, aunts, friends, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; though, except
in the case of dying patients, all women, except their wives and
mothers, are better away. I do not know what amount of
strictness in practice is shown in enforcing the Regulations in
English Army Hospitals; but if, at present, equivocal women,
as well as ascertained prostitutes, are not excluded (which very
possibly they are) they should be. At the same time, a sentry
may often be honestly puzzled as to equivocal or non-equivocal
appearance, in these days of over-dressing. And some mistake,
made by a stupid or brutal sentry, might lead to endangering
the rule. This whole matter must be referred to men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">12. Orderlies’
Attendance.</div>

<p>12. With regard to the question of the “Regulation” number
of Orderlies, viz., 1 to every 10 patients, it is to be
observed,&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">(1.) 40-Bed
Ward
Minimum Size
for Regulation
Number of
1 Attendant to
10 Patients.</div>

<p>(1.) A ward of 40 patients might be efficiently served (but
it would be hard work) with</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<ul>
<li>1 Head Nurse&mdash;Female.</li>
<li>3 Orderlies.</li>
</ul>

<p>With no number under 40 of patients to a ward, can the
Regulation proportion of 1 attendant to 10 patients be adhered
to.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2.) 20-Bed
Ward requires
3½ Attendants.</div>

<p>(2.) With a ward of 20 patients (cut, scheme, and arrange
the hours and duties as you will), you cannot efficiently serve
it with less than</p>

<ul>
<li>½ Head-Nurse&mdash;Female.</li>
<li>3 Orderlies.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the other ward of this Head Nurse ought to be on the
same floor.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;The same number would quite as efficiently serve a
ward of 25 or even 30 patients.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(3.) 10-Bed
Ward cannot
be served by
1 Orderly + ⅕
Nurse.</div>

<p>(3.) The Army system of 1 Orderly to 10 patients, with a
number not exceeding 10 patients to a ward, is upset as immediately
by one bad case among the 10, as by 9 to the 10.</p>

<p>For, is the same Orderly to be on duty for the 24 hours?</p>

<p>The difficulty is practically got over by the Army, with a
permission that any “bad case” may select any one he likes of
his comrades (out of the Depôt) to be “told off,” to attend
upon him.</p>

<p>This extraordinary regulation is equivalent to (and affords
little other practical result, than) granting opportunity for
any quantity of spirits, and illicit food, to be smuggled into
Hospital, and it is clear that it would be totally inadmissible in
a General Hospital, where the whole system of nursing would
be under the most stringent discipline and supervision.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(4.) Female
Nurses not to
be Substitutes
for Orderlies.</div>

<p>(4.) The introduction of Female Nurses into Military Hospitals
is not intended to supply the place of Orderlies, but to
perform a class of duties which never has been performed at all
in the Army. Few other Hospital duties of those generally
called such have been hitherto fulfilled, in Military Hospitals,
except</p>

<ul>
<li>diet-carrying,</li>
<li>sweeping,</li>
<li>and writing.</li>
</ul>

<div class="sidenote">(5.) Naval
Hospitals
Regulation
Number of
Attendants 1 to
7 Patients.</div>

<p>(5.) In all Naval Hospitals, the Regulation number of
attendants is 1 to every 7 patients, or 2 attendants for each
ward containing more than 7 patients and up to 14. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Attendants or Nurses, in sailor’s language, have charge of the
linen, bedding, and ward furniture, under the Ward Matron,
and they are responsible for the proper care of the sick, and
the due administration of the medicine, wine, and other medical
comforts. They are on duty all day and watch at night in their
turn, which is regulated by the Medical Officer in charge of the
ward, in this or similar fashion:&mdash;a group of three contiguous
wards is allotted during the night to two nurses, one begins her
duty at 9 and ends at 1 o’clock, when she is relieved by another,
who watches till 6. She patrols the three wards, resting in
that one where there may be a case requiring more than ordinary
attention. If there should be a case of fever, delirium, or other
sharp seizure, extra Nurses, both men and women, are assigned
to the charge of that special case, according to the urgency of
its wants. The great majority of Naval patients are either
convalescent, or suffering from trivial complaints, which do not
impair their activity. They can therefore take care of themselves,
and assist the Nurse during the day in cleaning the
wards, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>&mdash;and we know what good housemaids seamen make.
The Nurses are paid one shilling a night for night watching.
They have under the most severe circumstances two-and-a-half
nights in bed for half a night out of bed.</p>

<p>At Haslar Naval Hospital the system of Orderlies, as understood
from the Principal Medical Officer, is as follows:&mdash;12
Orderlies are on a floor, to look after, say, 90 patients.
These are divided for night duty into three divisions of 4 each;
of these 4&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>2 are on from 9 to 2, <span class="smcap">A. M.</span></li>
<li>2 <span class="ditto">are on from</span> 2 to 8.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Head-Quarter room or ward is the one which has the
most severe cases; this ward, then, the Watcher at night sits in,
and makes the rounds of the others every now and then to see
if anything is required. This system will of course be modified,
according to the nature of the cases in Hospital. The other
attendants do not sleep in the wards. The Nurses are male or
female according to the discretion of the Principal Medical
Officer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Civil Hospitals
have even 9
Attendants to
44 Patients.</div>

<p>In Civil Hospitals the number is as great of attendants to
patients, and is mainly determined by the size of the ward:</p>

<p><i>E.g.</i>, in one Hospital, where there are quadruple war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>ds of
44 patients, 11 in each compartment, though the average
number of patients is 48, the number of attendants is 7.</p>

<p>In exceptional cases extra Night-Nurses, sometimes extra
Day-Nurses serve particular patients. The labour, both of
cleaning and of night-nursing, is much increased by the wards
being four, separated by a large lobby.</p>

<p>In the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lariboisière</span> Hospital at Paris, where the wards hold
32 beds, 1 Sister, 1 Nurse, and 2 Orderlies on the Men’s side,
1 Sister, 2 Nurses, and 1 Orderly on the Female side, serve the
ward efficiently.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(6.) Same
Number of
Men will not

Work as an

<p>(6.) One woman does the work of more than a man in a
Hospital, speaking of the duties discharged by Under Nurses
in Civil Hospitals; for men are not accustomed to these
duties in England, as women are from their childhood.</p>

<p>From this it is by no means to be inferred that women of
the class of Under Nurses in Civil Hospitals should be
employed in Military Hospitals, which unquestionably they
should not. But it is to be inferred that the work will not be
done efficiently, with a smaller number of men than would be
employed of women.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(7.) Hospital
Attendance an
entirely new
subject in the
Army.</div>

<p>(7.) The question of attendance has scarcely been intelligently
considered in the Army at all. And hardly any practical
answer has yet been given to such questions as the above.</p>

<p>I conceive it to be practically impossible to serve 4 wards, as
proposed at Netley, viz., of 9 beds each, with</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></p>
<ul>

economy as unmanageable as nine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(8.) Hospital

than Barrack-Rooms
at
present.</div>

<p>(8.) A ward in a Military Hospital now may often be little
else than a barrack-room, with an Inspection by a Medical
Officer twice a day. It is designed to make it by the new
Regulations into a place where the sick must be and always
will be suitably attended. But this cannot be done by such a
scheme as&mdash;</p>

<p>though this attendance would be more than sufficient for 50
cases in one ward; but such a ward is considered in a sanitary
sense too large. Two wards of 30 beds each on the same floor
would be efficiently served by such a Staff, however; and there
would be no sanitary objection.</p>

the most critical cases to be attended by the rawest hands.</p>

every thing to and from the ward.</p>

Comparison of
Cost of
Nursing with
larger and

<p>(11.) The plan of Netley, with its wards for 9 sick, is by far
the costliest for administration, as the following facts will
prove:</p>

<p class="pseudo_list">I. It is proposed to provide the Hospital with Orderlies
and Nurses to conduct the nursing in wards of 9 sick,
as mentioned.</p>

<p class="pseudo_list">II. On sanitary grounds wards may safely be large enough
to accommodate 25 to 30 sick.</p>

<p class="noindent">We may therefore choose the larger wards, being guided only
by the cost of the nursing.</p>

<p class="pseudo_list">III. A ward of 9 sick would require 1 day and 1 night Orderly,
and a-third of a Nurse (that is, a Nurse could
superintend three such wards.)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p class="pseudo_list_cont">A ward of 30 sick would require 2 day and 1 night
Orderlies and 1 Nurse = 4 persons in all.</p>

<p class="noindent">Or if two such wards were on one floor, 1 Nurse could serve
both.</p>

<p class="pseudo_list">IV. We cannot count the cost of Orderlies and Nurses, including

Floors.</div>

<p>13. <span class="smcap">Floors.</span>&mdash;In building a new Hospital or laying a new
floor we shall hope to see, by degrees, everywhere introduced
the only safe Hospital floor. In the expense the difference
between oak and the best white deal ought never to be considered.
The staircases and passages should always be of stone.
When once an oak floor is well done with bees’-wax it is no
longer an absorbing surface. There cannot be a doubt that
the frequent washing of the floors, in London Hospitals, is one
main cause of Erysipelas and Hospital Gangrene.</p>

<p>But, with regard to deal flooring,&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) The best way with a pine floor already laid is to
close the joints, plane the surface quite smooth, and then
saturate the wood with beeswax and turpentine, either at
once, or after the wood has been saturated with “drying”
linseed oil well rubbed in.</p>

<p>(2.) Enough beeswax should be used to fill up the grain of
the wood, and rubbing with a brush will then smooth the surface.
It will be polished somewhat, but not slippery. The
amount of polish depends on the brushing.</p>

<p>(3.) The surface should be kept clean by using a brush with
a cloth tied over it, and if offensive liquids are spilt, they
should be immediately removed, the surface washed with soap
and water, and immediately dried.</p>

<p>(4.) List slippers, which ought to be part of Hospital furniture,
effectually obviate risk of slipping. It would hardly be
possible, however, to make deal floors as slippery as oak
<i>parquet</i>, because the surface (except of very fine deal, such as
is used for musical instruments) never takes so high a polish.</p>

<p>(5.) Dry rubbing, which is done with sand, or with sandstone,
is not well adapted for ordinary sick wards, on account
of the dust; unless it be very carefully done. The rationale
of it is to remove a certain amount of the surface of the floor.
It answers very well on board ship. A certain amount of
surface cleaning may be done by rubbing with a hard short
brush; it is, however, defective. The wood becomes in time
saturated with organic matter, and only wants moisture to give
off noxious effluvia.</p>

<p>(6.) Scrubbing is absolutely objectionable, for this reason.
In any schoolroom, reading-room, institute, which is much
inhabited, a smell, while the floor is being scrubbed, is very
perceptible, quite different from that of soap and water. It is
the exhalation from the organic matter which has entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
floor from the feet and breath of the inhabitants. How much
more dangerous this in Hospital Wards need hardly be said.</p>

<p>There is at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span> Hospital, at Berlin, a very admirable
flooring, which would be worth trying in England. The floors
throughout are wood, prepared in the following manner:&mdash;The
floor is first oiled with linseed oil, and then rubbed over with a
peculiar “laque” varnish, the technical process of which will
be found in the note,<a name="Anchor_15" id="Anchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a> and polished, so as to resemble French
polish. Every three years or so the rooms and wards are successively
emptied for a fortnight, when a new flooring is laid,
re-oiled, varnished with the laque varnish, and thoroughly
dried. Every day the floors are wet-rubbed by means
of a piece of sacking or coarse webbing at the end of
a long, hard broom, the performer stands for the performance,
also while immediately afterwards, having wrung
the sacking completely dry, she goes over the ground
again with the dry sacking. One, or, in case of the
weekly extra wet-rubbing, two dry rubbings, dry the floor
completely in a few minutes from the cessation of the wet-rubbing,
never more than ten minutes. Three or four times a
year the ward floors are thoroughly wetted with water thrown
on, and the floors scrubbed with a long brush. Nei<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>ther soap,
soda, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, is used.</p>

<p>The great advantages of this are:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) That it purifies the air exceedingly and freshens the
wards.</p>

<p>(2.) That it reduces the daily accumulation of dust to a
minimum.</p>

<p>(3.) That it dries completely within ten minutes from being
wet-rubbed.</p>

<p>(4.) That a woman, standing, can thoroughly clean a ward
with some hours less time, and greatly less fatigue, than scrubbing.</p>

<p>(5.) That wet scrubbing is sometimes and ought to be
always forbidden and dry rubbing substituted, on the score of
the unhealthiness of scrubbing.</p>

<p>(6.) That it would relieve us of all external scrubbers in the
Nurses’ own rooms. Each Nurse would sweep, wet-brush and
dry-brush her bed-room and day-room herself, daily, would
once-a-week give a little extra wash, and would wash the
wooden skirting which runs along the bottom of the walls.
As the bed-room must be tiny and the day-room small (it
would be better if we could keep to one room, which would
take a quarter of an hour daily, and the grand weekly purification
not more than one hour, even to a slow performer) a
short time daily and a moderate time weekly will do it.</p>

<p>One disadvantage of this very simple, very efficient, and
excellent flooring is, that it shows scratches. Furniture must
always be lifted, not dragged. In a Military Hospital where
men are always at hand, this would matter less as to the
wards, and the Nurses could help each other once a week in
their bed-rooms, and manage alone in their day-rooms.</p>

<p>There are four other examples of this flooring in Berlin
Hospitals.</p>

<p>(1.) <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethesda Siechenhaus</span>, a small old house, about to be
rebuilt and enlarged, in a suburb of Berlin, where three
Deaconesses, with a man and woman servant, take excellent
care of about forty infirm old women and imbecile children.
These patients, of the class to be found in the infirmary wards
of our workhouses, move about little, and have few visitors, so
that the flooring, which is the same as at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span>, is less
used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>(2.) <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hedwig’s Hospital, where 250 male and female
medical and surgical patients are nursed by Roman Catholic
Sisters of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Charles Borromæus (head quarters at Nancy),
with female servants and male nurses. The house is new; the
flooring the same as at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span>. The Superior, an intelligent
German, speaks much of its excellence for hospital purposes;
it is being introduced, though as yet very partially, into
France.</p>

<p>(3.) The great <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité</span> Hospital, the town-hospital for 1,200
patients, spite its French name. It consists of two buildings;
the old one, used in winter; and a splendid new one, into
which all the patients, except the lunatics and the small-pox
and the venereal cases, are moved for the six summer months.
The flooring throughout is of the same wood (deal) as at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span>,
but has much more laque. The more laque is used, the
brighter the floor shines, but the sooner it requires re-oiling
and laque varnishing. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité</span> floors are re-oiled with
laque every year; they are cleaned in the same way as at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span>,
only with more dry rubbing. On bad days, when the
numerous students have passed through, the ward floors occasionally
require to be cleaned; but, in general, even on these
occasions, it is enough to sweep them, and to clean the next
morning as usual.</p>

<p>(4.) The principal Military Hospital, the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Garnison Lazareth</span>
in the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hirsch Allée</span>, for 800 patients, usually not filled. The
flooring is the same as at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span>, except that no laque is
used. It is oiled generally, not always, yearly.</p>

<p>The <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ober Inspector</span>, a <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Landwehr</span> civilian, who is supreme
over the Hospital, and an <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ober-Stabs-Arzt</span>, both speak very
strongly as to the superiority of this flooring over all others for
Hospital use, and in particular over flooring which requires
scrubbing. It has only been introduced of late years. They
consider it equal to any amount of hospital wear and
tear. The military patients, like those of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité</span>, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span>,
and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hedwig’s, wear hospital slippers, with soles
thick enough to admit of their walking in the garden, when
fine; when not fine, they are not allowed to go out. This
flooring would not stand the constant tread of nailed shoes.
But often, on bad days as on fine ones, great numbers of
soldiers come to visit their sick comrades, and leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the floor very dirty; generally it is enough to sweep the
floor after the visitors are gone, and to clean it as usual
next morning; sometimes it is necessary to clean it the
same afternoon.</p>

<p>The flooring is cheap. Somewhat more expense attends
laying it down than the ordinary boards, and a certain
expense attends the re-oiling, but the constant outlay
for soap and soda is entirely saved, except a little soda
in the grand annual purification, with hot water, in addition to
the daily one with cold; the time and labour attending
scrubbing is saved, and above all the great gain to the sick
arising from its use is secured.</p>

<p>The strong, decided way in which the old grey-headed Army
Surgeon, and the middle-aged business-looking Civilian, spoke
of the merits of this flooring, and of its capacities, was exceedingly
satisfactory.</p>

<p>(5.) Two years ago the greater part of the boards in the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kaiserswerth</span> Institution, which are of deal, were oiled, both on
sanitary grounds, and to rid the Sisters of the drain on time
and strength in scrubbing. They are considered far preferable
to the old ones, and to answer in every respect. Yet the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kaiserswerth</span> floorings would not answer the English requirement
of extreme cleanliness. They are substantially clean, but,
like those of the Military Hospital of Berlin, it takes examination
to ascertain that they are so, and from the same cause&mdash;there
is no “laque.” Also the colour is not at all so agreeable
as the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span> colour. These oiled boards last a year
only. A moderate amount of laque is required to add to their
durability.</p>

<p>The sum of the information, condensed as much as possible,
on this subject is;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smrom">I.</span> The boards, which are always of deal, can be prepared in
three ways:</p>

<p>(<span class="smrom">I.</span>) Laquering, only suitable for reception rooms, or when
by some chance a ward is wanted to be got ready in a hurry;
it takes less time; after two or three days, the room or ward
can be used, and it shines brighter, but it lasts a much shorter
time than the other procedures, as it stands less the incessant
treading incident to all ward floors; it is also more expensive.
Let us consider it wholly unsuitable for wards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>(<span class="smrom">II.</span>) Oiled boards, with more or less laque.</p>

<p>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité</span> boards have a great deal of laque.</p>

<p>The <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span> and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hedwig’s boards much less.</p>

<p>(<span class="smrom">III.</span>) Oiled boards without any laque&mdash;</p>

<p>As in the Military Hospital.</p>

<p><span class="smrom">II.</span> Much laque makes the floors shine brighter; requires
more time to clean them; and earlier re-preparation than
where less laque is used.</p>

<p>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité</span> boards would be unmeaningly splendid for an
English Hospital, and quite out of place in a Military one;
besides entailing some unnecessary annual expense, and some
daily finicking care.</p>

<p><span class="smrom">III.</span> A small quantity of laque, as at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span>, gives an
amount of polish to the floors, which enables the eye at once
to ascertain whether they are clean or not; considerably
improves the appearance of the floor; and, according to all
high authority, adds both to the durability of the floor, and the
healthiness of the Hospital. It renders the whole flooring less
subject to cracks, to dirt and dust getting into holes and
corners; and, above all, by filling up the grain of the floor, it
prevents the saturation, by organic matter, which otherwise
takes place and which scrubbing only makes more mischievous.</p>

<p><span class="smrom">IV.</span> Where no laque is used, the absence of all polish on
the dark-brown floors makes examination necessary, to see
whether they are thoroughly clean or not. This flooring would
never satisfy the eye or the mind of an English Inspector-General
or Surgeon. But the main objection to the absence
of laque certainly consists in the sanitary one above stated.</p>

<p><span class="smrom">V.</span> All the various authorities agree in estimating very
highly the superiority of this flooring to flooring requiring
scrubbing. They all agree in their reasons for this preference,
viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<span class="smrom">I.</span>) The dampness which remains in a ward more or less
time after it has been scrubbed, is completely avoided.</p>

<p>(<span class="smrom">II.</span>) The tendency to miasma is greatly counteracted, both
by getting rid of the damp, which encourages and spreads
the exhalation of the organic saturations; and by making the
floor impervious, preventing dirt, and with dirt miasma, finding
its way into holes, chinks, and corners of the floor.</p>

<p>(<span class="smrom">III.</span>) The mode of cleaning this flooring, w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>hile it avoids
damp, daily purifies the ward air.</p>

<p>(<span class="smrom">IV.</span>) The floor, and its mode of cleaning, get rid more than
by any other way of dust, and of the miasma dust often
conveys.</p>

<p>(<span class="smrom">V.</span>) The time, labour, and expense of scrubbing are saved.</p>

<p>(<span class="smrom">VI.</span>) The Berlin authorities consider that these oiled boards,
with a small quantity of laque, are, on the whole, decidedly
cheaper than the common boards; that the boards last rather
longer; and that the avoidance of scrubbing saves more than
the extra preparation and its renewal cost, apart from the
sanitary gain.</p>

<p><span class="smrom">VI.</span> Against these advantages, the following disadvantages
are to be placed:</p>

<p>(<span class="smrom">I.</span>) This flooring shows where most used, instead of the
uniform appearance of the white scrubbed boards.</p>

<p>(<span class="smrom">II.</span>) Scratches show, and remain upon it; so all furniture
must be lifted, not dragged over it.</p>

<p>(<span class="smrom">III.</span>) The tread sounds a little more, little, but more, than
on white boards.</p>

<p>(<span class="smrom">IV.</span>) It would not stand the constant tread of nailed shoes;
and patients of a ward so floored, ought to wear slippers with
moderately thick soles. (The German Doctors consider the
use of slippers preferable to that of shoes, by the patients, as
keeping a ward much quieter, cleaner, and disturbing the
severe cases less.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smrom">V.</span>) Carpets could not be nailed on it, as the floor should
be daily cleaned. Several Hospital authorities whose rooms
are thus floored, have large pieces of carpet round the furniture
most used, bed, tables, sofas, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; these are daily taken
up and dusted while the floor is being cleaned. To many
English minds, the sight and feel of a carpet is essential to
the idea or feeling of comfort; and it might be sound policy,
in the event of a trial being made of this flooring, to leave the
Officers, Military and Medical (I do not mean patients), in
possession of scrubbed rooms and carpets. The Superintendent
might have one or two pieces of carpet for her rooms;
and the Nurses should dispense with carpet.</p>

<p>Both in the new part of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité</span> and at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span>, long
broad corridors run along the back of the wards which open
into them. The corridors are floored like the wards. In those
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité</span> a piece of long carpet is laid in the midst of the
corridors, where patients walk not a little. At <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span>, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
long piece of matting is laid in the midst of the corridors,
where the patients walk freely. Carpet of either kind is not
considered to benefit the floors, but to diminish the noise.
In the wards of Guy’s Hospital, for the same reason, a long
piece of matting is laid along the middle of the floors.</p>

<p><span class="smrom">VII.</span> This flooring is unsuited for stairs, though so used in
some Hospitals, as, in case of fire, oiled wood would burn
rather quicker than common wood. Hospital stairs should be
of stone.</p>

<p><span class="smrom">VIII.</span> It is also unsuitable for kitchens, wash-houses, water-closets,
and sinks. The floor round a stove or fire-place in a
ward or room should be protected by a strong plate of lead or tin.</p>

<p>It might also be as well to floor operation-rooms with flooring,
admitting of scrubbing, because these oiled boards do not
well stand sand or bran, and our Surgeons might be discomposed
at missing one or other of these things. Sand or bran
mixed with blood would make a mess, the traces of which
would show a little on this flooring. For the rest, it is particularly
easy to wipe blood off it. After each operation, one
or two minutes, a wet cloth of the kind here mentioned, and a
broom, remove the blood that has fallen, and leave a clean floor;
or if there has been a very great mess, five minutes, a wet
cloth to lap up the blood, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, another wet cloth, a pail, and a
broom, do all: after the operations are over, a few minutes’
whole or partial cleaning, as the case may be, make all tidy
again. Still, many English Surgeons expect to have sand or
bran thrown on the floor before, or just after the first blood
has fallen, and might object to standing some minutes on the
bloody floor, which spoils boots, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Red floorcloth, of sufficient
size, round the operating-table, might answer every
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smrom">IX.</span> On laying down the oiled boards for the first time, six
weeks should pass after the oiling and laquering before the
ward is inhabited.</p>

<p><span class="smrom">X.</span> After subsequent re-preparation of the floors, the longer
the wards are left vacant the more the floor both hardens and
shines; but for practical purposes the interval of a fortnight is
enough.</p>

<p><span class="smrom">XI.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></span> The flooring, so prepared, or re-prepared, ought, on an
average, to last about three years. In case of any extra
miasma, it is often desirable to hasten the re-preparation, and
to have it done after two years’ use. To do it annually is, unless
in some emergency, quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>Although the process cannot be said to be by any means
perfect, on account of the deficient durability of the surface,
it would be well worth while to try it in England, and, if it
answers and if it were improved, the sick would gain much,
and the Hospital staff would gain much&mdash;the latter much more
even in Civil, than in Military Hospitals.</p>

<p>But it would be incurring a great responsibility to have the
whole of a large new Hospital floored in this way, because,</p>

<p><span class="smrom">I.</span> An English climate has made, and makes, so many things
which are good and suitable abroad, unsuitable and sometimes
pernicious for England.</p>

<p><span class="smrom">II.</span> Our coal-fires, whether assisting or assisted by our atmosphere,
certainly give us an amount of soot and dirt unknown
abroad. At Berlin, all fire-places are stoves, where sometimes
coal, sometimes coal and wood are burnt.</p>

<p>This flooring might not stand well either the damp climate,
or the smoky atmosphere and amount of flying soot of
England: but it would be well worth trying; as also trying to
improve it.</p>

<p>By all accounts, a great deal depends upon the manner in
which these boards are prepared; a little more or a little
less, whether of oil or laque, makes a great and lasting difference.
It would never answer to make an English carpenter or
painter do this from written or printed directions.</p>

<p>If we obtain a trial of this floor&mdash;the best course would
be, to let an English carpenter prepare a number of
boards and skirtings, of due size, suitable for the new
flooring of some few wards in one of Her Majesty’s hospitals,
which requires new flooring; then to desire either
the proper tradesman, or the Queen’s Minister at Berlin, to
order the house-painter, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schonby</span>, No. 5, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Michael Kirchplatz</span>,
Berlin, to send an experienced, trustworthy foreman, with the
proper tools and materials, and for this man, with a complement
of English workmen, to prepare the boards.</p>

<p>The mode of cleaning is extremely simple, though of course
there is a knack to be learnt; and, like everything else, it can
be done well, indifferently, or ill. Any English man or wo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>man
accustomed to cleaning would understand the thing in one
morning, and would, if he or she opened instead of shutting
the mind to the outlandish thing, be proficient in it in a week.
All these things sound abstruse on paper, and are far more
simple and more easily learnt by seeing done than by reading.
The foreman ought to give one or two lessons to one or two
Orderlies, or Nurses, as the case may be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">14. Ventilation
of Wards.</div>

<p>14. <span class="smcap">Ventilation.</span>&mdash;The amount of fresh air required for
ventilation has been hitherto very much underrated, because it
has been assumed that the quantity of carbonic acid produced
during respiration was the chief noxious gas to be carried off.
The total amount of this gas produced by an adult in 24 hours
is about 40,000 cubic inches, which in a Barrack room of 16
men would give 370 cubic feet per diem. Allowing 8 hours
for the night occupation of such a room, when the doors and
windows may be supposed to be shut, the product of carbonic
acid would be 123 cubic feet, or about 15½ cubic feet per hour.
This large quantity if not speedily carried away would undoubtedly
be injurious to health; but there are other gaseous
poisons produced with the carbonic acid which have still
greater power to injure. Every adult exhales by the lungs
and skin 48 ounces or 3 pints of water in 24 hours. Sixteen
men in a Barrack-room would therefore exhale in 8 hours 16
pints of water and 15½ cubic feet of carbonic acid in the atmosphere
of the room. With the watery vapour there is
also exhaled a large quantity of organic matter ready to enter
into the putrefactive condition. This is especially the case
during the hours of sleep. And as it is a law that all excretions
are injurious to health if reintroduced into the system it is easy
to understand how the breathing of damp foul air of this kind,
and the consequent reintroduction of excrementitious matter
into the blood through the functions of respiration will tend to
produce disease.</p>

<p>This will be still more the case in sick wards overcrowded
with sick, the exhalations from whom are always highly morbid
and dangerous, as they are nature’s method of eliminating
noxious matter from the body, in order that it may recover health.</p>

<p>A much larger mass of air is required to dilute and carry
away these emanations than is generally supposed. And the
whole art of ventilation resolves itself into applying in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> any
specific case the best method of renewing the air sufficiently,
without producing draughts or occasioning great varieties in
temperature.</p>

<p>When the question of ventilation first assumed a practical
shape in this country, it was supposed that 600 cubic feet of air
per hour were sufficient for a healthy adult, in a room where a
number of people are congregated together. Subsequent experience
however has shown that this is by no means enough.
As much as 1,000 cubic feet have been found insufficient to
keep the air free from closeness and smell; and it is highly
probable that the actual quantity required will ultimately be
found to be at least 1,500 cubic feet per hour per man. In
sick wards we have more positive experience as to the quantity
of air required to keep them sweet and healthy. It has been
found in certain Parisian Hospitals, in which the ventilating
arrangements were deficient, that pyœmia and Hospital gangrene
had appeared among the sick in consequence. These
diseases disappeared on the introduction of ventilating arrangements,
whereby 2,000 cubic feet of fresh air per bed per hour
were supplied to the wards. Notwithstanding this large quantity,
however, the ward atmosphere was found not to possess
sufficient freshness or purity: and the quantity of air had to be
increased in subsequent ventilating arrangements. As much as
4,000 to 5,000 cubic feet per bed per hour have been supplied
in certain Hospitals. At the rate of 4,000 cubic feet, the ward
atmosphere is found perfectly fresh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Night
Ventilation.</div>

<p>At one of our largest London Hospitals it will be perceived
that above the one door of each ward is a large
ventilator, ordered to be open day and night&mdash;that beyond
this ventilator, which opens into the landing-place, is a
large window which opens into the external air; and thus
admits fresh air into the ward at night, diminishing the foul
night atmosphere. This night ventilation system is good;
but it requires careful watching, as chilly patients, Nurses, and
sometimes Sisters, are very apt to give, after they conclude the
rounds are over for the night, a sly pull at the rope and to
shut the window, and thus imbibe the foul air directly generated,
in quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Special Wards,
whether
desirable or
not.</div>

<p>15. <span class="smcap">Special Wards.</span>&mdash;It may be laid down as an axiom in
the management of sick affected with certain zymotic diseases,
such as fevers, cholera, dysentery, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, that they should be distributed
over a wide superficial area, and have a large allowance
of cubic space. Agglomeration of such cases in small ill-ventilated
wards is quite sufficient of itself to occasion a high proportionate
mortality among the sick. In mild climates and
seasons very little protection is necessary from the change of
temperature; so that the sick from epidemic diseases can be
camped out and exposed to the full influence of the atmosphere,
not only without danger, but often with great benefit. It is
only when the temperature is low and variable, and the season
inclement, that danger is likely to accrue from this exposure.
And hence the necessity of inquiring how we can best combine
the requisite elevation of temperature and the most suitable
amount of cubic space and ventilation for the treatment of
these diseases in Hospitals.</p>

<p>Medical Men generally are satisfied that these ends cannot
be safely arrived at by agglomerating sick in fever wards in Hospitals.
And hence has arisen a practice, which experience
appears to have approved, of intermingling a small number of
fever cases in wards containing a certain number of sick from
other diseases. The practice appears to be not only perfectly
safe, but advantageous for the sick. It is known, however, that
if the proportion of fever cases exceeds a certain number, the
other cases in the ward are apt to become affected with fever.
It would appear as if, so far as the fever is concerned, the cubic
space occupied by other diseases was to a certain extent available
for the use of the fever cases. But the proportion of such
cases, that can be advantageously placed among the general
sick of any ward, will depend upon the size of the ward, the
means of ventilation, the number of cubic feet per patient, the
position of the windows, the exposure of the building, and other
similar circumstances.</p>

<p>Again, it is doubtful whether the preservation of an uniform
temperature in any Hospital, even in one set apart for chest
complaints, is beneficial for the sick, or whether it be beneficial
to agglomerate consumptive cases, without very special precautions,
under the same roof. Without discussing the validity
of the opinions held in Southern Europe as to the contagious
nature of consumption, it may be very fairly doubted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> whether a
number of cases placed under a common roof, and breathing a
common atmosphere, would not yield a higher rate of mortality
than the same cases would do if distributed through the wards
of a well-ventilated Hospital, among other diseases.</p>

<p>The subject is worthy of examination. At all events the
phenomena observed in this disease in the warmer climates of
Europe have led to the popular belief above stated; and it
would appear to point to a higher rate of mortality as a not
unlikely result of the establishment of special Hospitals or
wards for consumptive diseases, unless extraordinary care were
taken to ventilate them properly, and to imitate the natural
variations of temperature which appear to be necessary for
recovery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16. Proposed
Regulations as
to Payments,
by Superintendent-General.</div>

<p>16. All salaries and wages of Matrons and Nurses should be
paid, on the Superintendent-General’s order, from the Hospital
chest, to the Matron, who should pay the wages and other
expenses of the Nurses, and account for all monies received by
her on such orders. All outfits and travelling expenses, in
cases of transfer, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, should be provided on the order of the
Superintendent-General.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinion as to
Superintendent-General
paying
Wages and
Salaries.</div>

<p>There would be considerable difficulty in the way of making
all payments at a distance to Nurses, direct from the Superintendent-General,
otherwise than by orders on the Hospital
chest or Treasury. But there can be no doubt that the Nurses
ought to be paid by the Matron and by no one else. The
service of Nurses in Hospital is a peculiar service, and if not
successfully conducted by influence never can be by coercive
discipline. It would be a great mistake, therefore, to throw
away any means of influence which we can command, and the
“eye of the maid-servant is to the hand of her mistress” now
as it was 2,000 years ago. The fact of paying and being paid
helps greatly to establish the proper mutual relations between
the superior and the subordinate. The Matron would draw
from the Hospital Treasury, on the orders of the Superintendent-General,
and would account to her. As a matter of discipline,
it would make no material difference whether the
orders of the Superintendent-General, in favour of the
Matron, for the pay of the Nurses, are cashed by the Hospital
Treasurer or by a banker, always supposing that the Tr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>easurer
is bound to honour those orders, as any other banker would.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Matrons
abroad may
dismiss Nurses
under appeal.</div>

<p>The Matron, in any Hospital out of Great Britain and
Ireland, should be able, with the concurrence of the Governor of
the Hospital, to dismiss and send home any Nurse; or the
Governor himself, on his own responsibility, may direct the
Matron to do so, under appeal, however, in either case, to the
Superintendent-General, who shall decide, after the arrival of
the Nurse, whether she is to be dismissed or whether she may
be placed in another Hospital.</p>

<p>It should be secured, not left to chance, that the Matron be
immediately made acquainted with any complaint of the
Medical Officers against a Nurse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Matron to
draw Rations
and Extras.</div>

<p>The Matron should be able to draw from the Purveyor, on
her own indent, with the sanction of the Governor of the Hospital,
such rations and extras as she may consider necessary for
the Nursing establishment, and make the arrangements for
cooking. In the United Kingdom the Matron should be able
to make arrangements, subject to the approval of the Superintendent-General,
for commuting rations for mess-money, not
pay.</p>

<p>The Governor is responsible for the sufficiency of all supplies
and none ought to be expended, without his sanction. This
might be indispensable, if there were danger that supplies might
run short.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinion as to
Governor’s
jurisdiction
over Nurses.</div>

<p>Upon both these latter points, supposing the Governor of a
General Hospital to exist, he must have power to maintain the
discipline of the Hospital, in all its Departments, as a General
commanding a division has, in regard to every regiment composing
it. But he ought to exercise it only through the
Matron, as commanding a corps. He must also have power to
require the exclusion from the Hospital of any Nurse whose
conduct he may find to be inconsistent with maintenance of
discipline, and this power he would enforce, on his own responsibility,
by directing the Matron to remove the offending Nurse
from the Hospital. The conduct of the Nurse would become
the subject of investigation afterwards, in terms of the established
regulations. But practically such a case could hardly
occur, unless by the fault of the Matron, who would, of her
own accord, desire to remove a Nurse, on being satisfied that
such a measure was necessary or expedient. It would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
proper, too, both for her own justification and for the maintenance
of the Governor’s supremacy in the Hospital, that the
Matron should obtain his concurrence in the removal of a
Nurse from the Hospital. The proceedings, in all such cases,
would, of course, be reported by the Matron to the Superintendent-General.</p>

<p>Whether the Governor has the power of removing the
Matron, who clearly and properly ranks among the officers
under him, should be settled and not left to be disputed about
in a distant station. At all events, if he has this power over
her, it must be guarded, as extending only to suspension from
office, in cases of alleged flagrant neglect or misconduct, till
the whole matter can be remitted and decided on by the
Superintendent-General.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17. Nurses’
Wages.</div>

<p>17. Generally, as to the question of wages and pensions,
a regulation that Nurses shall have a small annual increase of
wages is better than one giving an increase after five or three
years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Efficiency of
Nurses does
not increase by
springs and
starts, like
Grasshoppers.</div>

<p>Efficiency does not go by starts and springs, like grasshoppers,
but makes “a small annual increase,” like the wages
proposed.</p>

<p>Nay, I appeal to everyone with experience in these matters
whether the greatest improvement is not made the first year,
the second year a little less, and so on the third and fourth,
till, when the fifth year comes, if improvement has not been
made by that time, it never will be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first five
years a
constant
improvement.
Afterwards if
there has not
been
improvement
made before,
no hope at all.</div>

<p>For trust-worthiness is the true efficiency of a Nurse. And
it may safely be said that, if by the end of the first year she has
not improved in trust-worthiness, she had better go; and if she
have not almost reached her culminating point by the fifth
year, she certainly will not improve afterwards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three
principles in
Wages.</div>

<p>The reasonable principle I believe to be, 1, to begin improving
the wages at as early a period as possible; 2, to let them
increase till the Nurse reaches her maximum of efficiency; and,
3, after that to make no more increase.</p>

<div class="sidenote">By rate of
Wages to
retain those
who are
efficient.</div>

<p>Because the object is to induce the young and efficient
women to stay, not the old ones. They will stay long enough,
because the old ones nobody else will take.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">By rate of
Pension to
reward those
who have been
efficient.</div>

<p>The rate of pension ought, on the other hand, to increase
with the number of years’ service, and continue increasing till
the end. The principle of pensioning is different from that of
wages. After the woman has reached her maximum of efficiency,
which certainly will be not later than forty-five, probably
not later than forty years of age, the inducement to stay should
be the improvement of pension. This compensates for any
apparent injustice in the first principle towards an old
servant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Civil Service
an Example.</div>

<p>No other system appears to be founded on common sense; and
it is one generally acknowledged in the Civil Service, where
salaries are made to rise as soon as possible. Military Hospitals
must not be made training schools for Nurses; else it
would be better to admit them much younger than at the age
of thirty years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinion as to
Wages and
Pensions.</div>

<p>If a Nurse cannot enter the Service till after she is thirty,
the majority will no doubt be some years above thirty when
they enter, say an average of thirty-five; and five years
appear a very long probation for a person at that age before
increase of wages begins. In most cases, in Civil Departments,
there is only one year of such probation before increase
begins, though the persons are much younger when they enter.
A maximum might be fixed, beyond which the wages should
not rise, and when the increase of pension would be sufficient
inducement to remain. Very few Nurses can be expected to
continue really efficient till sixty years of age; but it is often
difficult to say that a person is disabled, though she may have
become less active and efficient. If there is no retiring allowance
there will be great reluctance to dismiss her, and it
might, in that case, be cruel. The better plan would be
to promise a small pension after ten or twelve years’ service,
on a scale so graduated thereafter as to offer an inducement to
remain, at the same time that it would afford facility for
enforcing retirement without injustice. This would be economy.
The “Nursing Sisters” grant <abbr title="20 pounds">£20</abbr> after twelve years’
service.</p>

<p>After a time there may probably be difficulty in dismissing
persons who have done good service for ten years, but have
declined in efficiency, unless there is a retiring allowance.
They may be reluctant to retire; and, if so, it would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>lmost
impossible to dismiss them, without some kind of provision.
This is a difficulty which is encountered in every employment
in which there is no such provision. Persons who can hardly
be said to be disabled but who have become less efficient are
retained, because, if dismissed, they have no means of livelihood.</p>

<p>I have consulted the best authorities upon these points; and
I find the following general principles admitted:&mdash;</p>

<p class="neohead"><span class="smcap">General Principles as to Wages and Pensions.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">(1.) Same
Salary at first.</div>

<p>(1.) At whatever age a Nurse enters the Service she shall
begin with the same salary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2.) Same
Annual rate of
increase.</div>

<p>(2.) The annual rate of increase shall be the same for all
ages of entrance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(3.) Maximum
Salary fixed.</div>

<p>(3.) The maximum salary shall not exceed £<span class="spread-out_space">&nbsp;</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(4.) Pension
for Service
after Ten
Years.</div>

<p>(4.) The pension for service shall not begin until ten years
of completed service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(5.) Amount
of Pension a
certain Percentage
on
mean Salary
of preceding
year.</div>

<p>(5.) The amount of pension shall be a certain percentage on
the salary during the year preceding that on which she is pensioned.</p>

<p class="neohead"><span class="smcap">Applications of the foregoing Principles.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">(1.) Annual
rise of Wages
till the
maximum of
efficiency.</div>

<p>(1.) That the wages of Nurses shall rise annually, for a definite
number of years, attaining their maximum, on an average,
at the age forty-five, when the Nurses are found to be most
efficient.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2.) After five
years’ Service
Pension for
Disability.</div>

<p>(2.) That, after five years’ service, the Nurse shall, in the
case of <span class="smcap">ABSOLUTE DISABILITY</span>, become entitled to a pension
during the period of her disability.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(3.) Pension
on a Scale
graduated on
the Wages.</div>

<p>(3.) The pension will be on a scale graduated on the wages.
It will be twenty per cent. of the annual wages in the year of
service, 5–6, and the rate to be granted will rise progressively
two per cent. per annum, until the rate on the wages becomes
seventy per cent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(4.) A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>ll
Nurses to
retire at Sixty.</div>

<p>(4.) All Nurses will be placed on the Retired List at the age
of sixty.<a name="Anchor_16" id="Anchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">(5.) Nurses to
serve again
who are
Pensioned for
Disability,
when
Disability
ceases before
Sixty.</div>

<p>(5.) Those Nurses who are pensioned at an earlier age, for
disability, will, if called upon, be liable to serve when that
disability ceases, or to forfeit their pension. They must
therefore bring an annual medical certificate of disability to the
Superintendent-General, in order to receive their pension.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(6.) Nurses
partially
Disabled to
receive partial
Pension.</div>

<p>(6.) Nurses who are partially disabled will only be
entitled to a certain proportion of the pension allowed in the
scale, to be determined, on representation made by the Superintendent-General.</p>

</table>

<p>These principles, if admitted, would suggest the following
heads for regulations as to Nurses’ wages and pensions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">(1.) Amount
of Wages, first
year, £20.</div>

<p>(1.) At whatever age a Nurse enters the service, the amount
of wages paid to her during her first year of service, will be
£20.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2.) Annual
rate of increase
up to <abbr title="50 pounds">£50</abbr>,
when it ceases.</div>

<p>(2.) There will be an annual rate of increase of wages equal
to 10 per cent, of the first year’s wages, until the yearly wages
amount to <abbr title="50 pounds">£50</abbr>, beyond which there will be no further
increase.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(3.) No
Pension till
Ten Years’
Service
completed, nor
for Disability
till Five
Years.</div>

<p>(3.) A pension will be awarded for service to any Nurse, who
may retire, on account of age, at the expiry of ten full years’
service, but in case of disability, a Nurse shall receive a pension
after five years’ service, or a gratuity, according to circumst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>ances,
if discharged for disability, before she has completed
five years of service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(4.) Rate of
Pension.</div>

<p>(4.) Rate of Pension. The pension will be on a scale graduated
on the wages. It will be 30 per cent. of the wages received
by the Nurse in her tenth year of service, and the
pension granted to Nurses who have served more than ten
years, will rise at the rate of 2 per cent. of the wages for every
additional year of service, until the pension amounts to 70 per
cent. of the wages received during the year preceding its
grant, beyond which no higher pension will be granted, except
in cases of special devotedness to the public service, when an
addition to the regulated rate of any pension may be granted
on special recommendation, made by the Superintendent-General
of Nurses, setting forth the nature of the service for
which such augmented pension is to be granted.<a name="Anchor_17" id="Anchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a> But no such
pension shall exceed the amount of £50.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(5.) Nurses,
Pensioned for
Disability,
whose
Disability
ceases, may be
called on for
Service.</div>

<p>(5.) Any Nurse pensioned for disability, may be called on
for service in the event of such disability ceasing before the
age of sixty, in which case her wages will be the same as they
would have been, had she not been disabled.</p>

<p>(6.) Every Nurse who has completed her sixtieth year, must
retire from the service on her rate of pension.</p>

<p>(7.) Any Nurse, temporarily or permanently disabled in the
service, who has served more than five and under ten years, will
be entitled to a lower rate of pension, according to the circumstances
of each case, as represented by the Superintendent-General.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18. Number of
Nurses to
Patients.</div>

<p>18. Nurses should be selected and appointed by the Superintendent-General
of Nurses for each General Hospital, in a
proportion not exceeding one nurse for every twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
cases.</p>

<p>There is nothing so fatal to discipline as to require by regulations
what it is known and admitted cannot be performed. Such
rules are made to be broken. Therefore, is it not better,
instead of fixing a number to fix a limit, and say “not exceeding
one to every 25 or 30 patients,” leaving it to the Superintendent-General
to economize Nurses, and not appoint the
full number permitted, unless when really necessary? In one
case she might consider one nurse for fifty or even sixty sufficient;
in another, one for every twenty-five might be few
enough. Why tie up her hands against economy as well as
against extravagance?</p>

<p>At the same time it is necessary to state&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) That, by all accounts, at home and abroad, in the
English and in foreign armies, the proportion of severe cases is
very considerably less, in time of peace, in a Military Hospital
than in a Civil one, especially in the surgical wards.</p>

<p>(2.) That the Nurse’s time, being relieved of the waste
incurred by fetching and waiting for things, the cleaning of
the ward being done by Orderlies, and, an important item, the
Ward-Master being responsible for the serving the patients’
food, twenty-five sick are not enough, on an average, to occupy,
properly, her time.</p>

<p>(3.) That idleness, always pernicious, is never more so than
to Hospital-Nurses.</p>

<p>(4.) That petting the patients, by way of filling up time,
would be, of the two, more pernicious than idleness.</p>

<p>(5.) That it is most important, apart from these reasons, to
train and accustom these Nurses to serve efficiently large
numbers of patients, so as to make them useful in war-service,
where every woman who can be spared is better away; and
where a small efficient staff would, please God, do excellent
service.</p>

<p>(6.) That it is not in human nature, taking its average, supposing
the Regulations lay down that the proportion is not to
exceed 25, for many Nurses not to murmur at having more;
whereas they ought from the first to understand, that the service
is a very laborious one, and that none but women able and
willing to undergo and render laborious service, ought to enter
it, or be suffered to remain in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>(7.) Care must be taken therefore that in fixing this minimum,
no use may be made of it dangerous to the service, either
in the Hospital work itself, or in provoking adverse criticisms
upon these Regulations in quite different places. Twenty-five
cases are not generally enough.</p>

<div class="sidenote">19.
Precautions
in sending
Nurses abroad.</div>

<p>19. It would be expedient to take the advice of an able and
honest man of business as to whether the Superintendent-General
should, on engaging a Matron or Nurse, have her
signature to a bond or not. On the one hand, we know what
bonds are to loose consciences, and if the promulgation of the
Regulations give undoubted power to the Superintendent-General
and to her Matrons on foreign stations, I should prefer
having no bond. But this is for a man of business to answer.
It is important to remember that the power of instant dismissal
for misconduct, and of sending the Nurse home must be
retained, which renders the service different from ordinary female
service. A discharged governess or servant, if she insisted on
remaining at her own expense at the foreign station, could not
be sent home forcibly by her late mistress; now it is essential
that an offending Nurse be forthwith passed on board the
first returning ship. Also performances similar to those of
one or two of the women in the War-Hospitals who, on
hearing of good situations, misbehaved in order to be discharged,
ought to be effectually prevented. A lawyer must
advise, first, if it can be; secondly, how it can be done. The
Superintendent-General, on sending abroad Nurses, ought to
have some security either that they remain there and do their
duty, or that they be sent home for her judgment if they fail in
duty. To have them either going abroad as Nurses by way of
securing a free passage, and then looking out for lucrative
situations, or accepting the offers which might, and, occasionally,
undoubtedly would, be made to them, would be most injurious
to the Service. Can it be prevented by any stronger measure
than the instant forfeiture of all claim to the eventual pension?
If so, it should. Could this power be extended to the washerwomen
who would probably be sent with the Nurses ordered
to War or out-of-the-way foreign stations? Perhaps it will
simplify things not to include them in the Regulations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hospital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Laundries.</div>

<p>The persons provided by the Officer, whoever he may be,
to attend to the hospital linen under the orders of the Matron,
will be pretty sure to give the Matron trouble. But it is much
better to begin very modestly, and to avoid alarming the
Attendance Department; and so to be content with the people
provided in the linen store, and not at all to invade the regions
of the kitchen. By degrees, please God the work prospers, it
may be extended. I fear a laundry of men, except in war-service,
will be a costly and inefficient concern. Yet a laundry
of women, exempt from the control of the Matron, would be
probably the worse evil of the two. And it is both right and
expedient to move very slowly, and to begin with the nursing
service alone. Ultimately, if we invade both laundry and
kitchen, I should still wish, in both, to have as few women as
possible. The fewer women are about an Army Hospital the
better.</p>

</div>

<p>1. In considering the Pavilion Plan to be in future received
as the sanitary necessity for Hospital construction, we must
look upon it as susceptible of many modifications.</p>

<p>And, particularly in adapting it for a Military Hospital, we
must ask by what modification can it be made, 1. Most economical
as to attendance, a greater amount of which is rendered
necessary than by other plans of construction.</p>

<p>2. Easy as to supervision; and, of course, a Hospital spread
over the extent of space now proved to be essential by sanitary
knowledge, whether built on the Pavilion plan or not, must
multiply the amount of supervision over that required in the
concentrated over-crowding of the old Hospital system (over-crowding
not with regard to cubic space in the wards, but to
the superficial area on the ground).</p>

<p>3. Economical as to the number of sick to be accommodated
on the same floor, so as to save unnecessary waste of time and
strength on the stairs to both Ward-Masters and Nurses.
Each Nurse should have, in time of peace, not less than from
50–60 patients under her charge.</p>

<p>4. Efficient as to convenient ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>commodation for Nurses and
Ward-Masters, near to the wards of which they are in charge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Pavilion
Plan
indispensable
on Sanitary
grounds. Its
Difficulties, on
the score of
Discipline in
Military
Hospitals, to
be openly met
and guarded
against.</div>

<p>1. The Pavilion Plan, while it is incontestably superior,
on sanitary grounds, to any other, while it perhaps may be
made equally economical, with regard to building, is more
expensive than the older crowded and badly-constructed Hospitals,
not only as to ground, but because each separate
entrance, staircase, set of appurtenances, represents an additional
cost of materials, and of hands to keep them clean and
in order. Human life is, however, a more expensive article
than any other. If human beings, and especially sick human
beings, are to be spread over as much space as possible, which
is now known to be an essential to health and more especially
to recovery, this must be done under any system and can be
best done under the Pavilion system. It of course necessarily
entails a greater amount and cost of attendance and of supervision.
Pure air and light are the prime necessities of a hospital.
These are best secured by the Pavilion Plan, and therefore
it is the cheapest in the end. As to the hands, there never
ought, never will, never can, be a superfluity of hands in a well-regulated
Hospital. The duty of the hands consists of two parts&mdash;to
keep the Hospital clean; to attend the sick. I had rather
not enumerate the instances where I have seen that, often from
the most various causes, one result arises&mdash;that more time
and care is given to floors, stairs, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, than to the
sick. Extreme cleanliness is of vital importance; this
should be combined with extreme simplicity of detail,
and with providing for considerable numbers at once. You
can effectually clean a large ward in much less time than
two small ones; a long stair than two short ones, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Extreme,
<em>not finicking</em>, cleanliness, thorough ventilation, for which an
ample supply of opposite windows will certainly in the long run
prove infinitely the best plan, and careful nursing, are probably
the main conditions, humanly speaking, of a large proportion of
cures&mdash;subsidiary to the medical or surgical treatment.</p>

<p>Sanitary necessities are never to be rejected, on account of
the trouble they give or of the means of cleanliness which they
render necessary. Because the saving of life, not the saving of
trouble, is the object of all sanitary appliances, Hospitals among
the number. And the saving of life is the only real economy.
If you have saved “hands” and trouble, and lost life, you
have been extravagant. The object is not to banish appliance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>s
which will cost trouble in keeping them clean, but to discover
those appliances which can be kept clean, at least cost of
labour. And this is perfectly possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Easy
Supervision to
be provided for.</div>

<p>2. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vincennes</span> modification of the Pavilion plan has been
adopted, among other reasons, for the greater facility of supervision
it affords. The Military Superior, the Surgeon, the
Matron, can at any instant pop in upon any ward of a
Hospital which has one roof. Each pavilion may, unless the
matter be specially considered with a view to providing this
effectual supervision, perceive the approach of any inspector.
The system of scouts, watch, alarm, is well understood
in many hundred wards, whose patients would be puzzled
to give the things names. Military patients will know both
things and names. Remember that Ward-Masters, Orderlies,
and Nurses require inspection as well as patients. Whatever
system of Hospital construction is adopted should provide for
easy supervision, at unexpected times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. If from
24–30
Patients be the
right Number,
Sanitarily
speaking, for
a Ward, the
Pavilion Plan
should, in a
Military
Hospital,
be so arranged
that more than
one such Ward
should be on
the same floor,
for facility of
Supervision.</div>

<p>3. The more we see of different systems, the more we see
the great mistake of giving a Nurse too little to do.</p>

<p>Twenty-four ordinary sick or surgical cases are too few for
a Head Nurse.</p>

<p>In a Military Hospital, the proportion of heavy cases
is in ordinary times considerably below the average proportion
of such cases in a Civil Hospital, open, as the latter
is, to accidents, and to the cases of dangerous disease always
more or less rife in low and crowded neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>Upon an average, a third or a fourth of the cases in the
ordinary surgical wards of a Military Hospital will be ulcers
from causes honest and dishonest. What these men will require
is rest (the cleanliness which is often so irksome a novelty
to the corresponding Civilian patient is routine to the soldier),
and very simple treatment.</p>

<p>It is most important, if possible, to form a staff of active,
laborious, useful women, who, if ordered on war-service, can at
once cope with numbers, and serve efficiently a considerable
number of heavy cases.</p>

<p>Relieved of all cleaning, and relieved of the great loss of
time incurred by fetching, waiting, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, none of these
Nurses, who are, in fact, Head Nurses, should serve less than
forty men. And, as I before submitted, I had rather she ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>ved
fifty or sixty than forty.</p>

<p>Give them twenty-four patients, and either they will become
idle, finicking women, or they will take to petting the patients,
a thing to be sedulously avoided everywhere, most of all in
Military Hospitals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. Importance
of the Head
Nurse
sleeping close
to her Ward.</div>

<p>4. The more we see of different systems, the more apparent
becomes the importance of the Head Nurse (all these are Head
Nurses) sleeping close to the ward:&mdash;</p>

<p>As regards the efficiency of her service:&mdash;</p>

<p>As regards the saving her own time, strength, and securing
her a modicum of comfort in a work where, if she does her
duty, she will never have a superfluity of comfort. Time,
strength, and this modicum of comfort, enter much into a
Nurse’s health&mdash;and health is essential both for efficiency and
economy.</p>

<p>Where the Nurse sleeps at a distance from her ward, her
efficiency, both as to superintendence and work, especially at
night, in dangerous cases, is seriously impaired.</p>

<p>If she sleeps at a distance from her ward, her comfort, also,
such as it is, is destroyed. Whatever a Nurse does for herself,
she must do by fits and starts. A really efficient Head Nurse
is never able to make anything for herself, though she often
would far rather save the money it costs to “put it
out.” The most simple mendings, even the feat of stowing
away the laundress’ supply of a Saturday evening, become,
when a ward is heavy, or when there are two or three of those
cases of urgent danger, so many of which, by God’s blessing,
the assiduous care of these women saves, year by year, in
our Hospitals, a procedure done in several acts. The misery
of dividing her small effects (the smaller the better) between
a day-room and a distant sleeping-room, the unseemliness and
inconvenience of carrying things backwards and forwards,
cannot be described.</p>

<p>If it be possible, the Nurses must sleep adjoining their
wards; and it will not do to give each only 24 patients.</p>

<p>It would be considerably better, if feasible, to have two
Nurses in contiguous rooms; but in the Pavilion Plan this
would involve bringing one Nurse away from her ward; and
rather than this, the next best, though inferior plan is to put
one Nurse immediately above and below the other, with a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>distinct
bell which she can in a moment ring from her bed into
the other Nurse’s room, to summon her if needed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of
Lighting
Hospital
Wards by Gas,
with Sanitary
Precautions.</div>

<p>Some years ago gas was laid on in the Sisters’ rooms in
Guy’s Hospital. In the other Hospitals there is an allowance
of candle to each Sister. The disadvantages of gas are
its alleged unhealthiness and its certainly being disagreeable
to some eyes. Its advantage is its cheapness. Liberty
to buy a candle and not use the gas is allowed at Guy’s.
As it will be a very important thing to conduct the
Nursing Service as economically as possible, and as there
must not be any wretched false economy as to essential
matters, which in the end always proves waste, it will be well
to save as much as can be in matters not essential. It
would be worth while to ascertain the average amount of
saving which the substitution of gas for an allowance of
candle has effected at Guy’s. Gas is used in the wards of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew’s, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s, and Guy’s, day and night.
It appears, when ventilation is properly attended to, to answer
well, and to do no harm. At night the gas is lowered so as to
leave the ward just light enough to see all that is done in it:
if bleeding, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> occurs, it can in an instant be raised, and the
ward lighted up. London Hospital burns gas in the evening,
and throughout the passages at night; but when the night
watch begins at nine, the wards are dark, except the Nurse’s
candle. A spare candle, un-lighted, is always at hand.</p>

<p>It is very important for the order of a ward that
the attendant in charge, and also any inspector suddenly
entering, should see at once all that is going on in the ward.
Where there are dangerous cases, this is of great moment;
and where there are not, it is equally necessary for the police
of the ward. A candle or a rushlight give insufficient light.
Properly lowered, gas at night does not disturb the patients.
After a night or two, those who are accustomed to sleep in the
dark get used to it. If the Nurse sleeps adjoining the ward,
there <em>must</em> be sufficient light in the ward at night. If the
gas-fittings are properly tight and if every gas-burner has a
ventilator, so that the products of combustion are effectually
conveyed away, for each gas-jet consumes as much air as eleven
men, it would be greatly preferable that there should be a low
gas light in the wards at night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">II.&mdash;1. Should
it be necessary
to serve one
Pavilion with
one Nurse
means by
which this
could be
effected.</div>

<p>II.&mdash;1. Suppose the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lariboisière</span> plan retained, as proposed
at Aldershot, for a Military Hospital, with wards of twenty-four
beds each&mdash;then, with fear and trembling, but with the
firm conviction that it is better for human nature, most of
all, for nursing human nature, to have somewhat too much
than a great deal too little to do, I respectfully recommend
that one Nurse serve the three wards of each Pavilion.</p>

<p>One woman cannot sleep alone in the Pavilion. The Nurses
must sleep together near the Matron’s quarters. If the
Nurses sleep away from the wards there should be some way
by which a Nurse can at once be summoned, in case of any
urgency in her ward, and it would be well to consider this in
the distribution of quarters. Either the Matron should lock
the Nurses’ quarters at night, and any summons should be
brought to her and by her referred to the Nurse; or the
summons should go straight to the Nurse’s door. There are
difficulties both ways, even supposing these summons should
be unfrequent. The Nurse of each Pavilion should inhabit the
room on the ground-floor ward, where the heaviest surgical
cases will be probably placed, whence she can better command
the movements of the Pavilion, and attend the entrance of the
Surgeon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Head
Nurse’s Day in
a Pavilion
Hospital.</div>

<p>2. Her day might be something like this (in time, perhaps,
God will bless us with some Army Chaplain who will get up
early and give us a very short service morning and evening):&mdash;</p>

<p>She should be effective, and enter the Pavilion about 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
go through the wards, read prayers in one by turns at the
appointed hour, and give out the linen wanted. (Six is the
nominal hour when the Head Nurses of one great London
Hospital enter on their duty.) Here must be no nominal
hours, all must be real, though not overstrained. Then the
dressings, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, attendance on Surgeons, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> With 72 patients
on different floors, she must train the Orderlies to do the
lighter dressings (by training I mean real teaching, not leaving
the Orderly to find them out himself); she must see all the
wounds of all her wards which she does not dress herself at
least every other day (which she can do by seeing some in the
morning and some in the evening), and she must dress the
heavy cases of all the wards herself. All this, with method,
and not losing time by fetching and waiting, an efficien<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>t Head
Nurse can do.</p>

<p>She must be responsible for the linen of the wards; but this
must be simplified as much as can be, so as to secure responsibility,
yet relieve the Nurse of unnecessary time spent over it.</p>

<p>The Nurse should be relieved of all writing and counting,
on the score of loss of time incurred. It will not do to
charge a Nurse, with seventy-two patients on three different
floors, with serving each man his portion of diet; the diets of
two wards would get cold while she was serving the first. It
will be better to make the Ward-Master of Pavilion wards
responsible for the serving the diets. There must, of course,
be a card at each bed, or some other record, showing the diet
the man is ordered. The Nurse must know at a moment’s
glance what each patient is ordered.</p>

<p>The largest London wards are the two male accident
wards in the London Hospital. Each Head Nurse has charge
of five wards of 12 beds, separated (and in some respects
impeded) by two lobbies. Very often there are fifteen beds in
each ward (not by over crowding), and these Head Nurses are
often to be seen in charge of seventy-five patients each, including
many serious, and some urgent cases. The two lobbies,
the small wards, and the duty of some daily writing and arithmetic
in settling the diets, with some daily loss of time in
fetching and waiting for medicine, render a Head-Nurse’s
service, as regards “manual” labour, less efficient than it
might be; even where she is most efficient.</p>

<p>Relieve the Nurses as much as possible of all writing and
arithmetic. If it could be possible to relieve them altogether
of the “settling” the diets, so much, by a great deal, the
better. In the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lariboisière</span> system, with one Nurse to each
Pavilion, it is utterly impossible to prevent the Nurse losing
daily time and strength on the stairs. But, relieved of writing,
of arithmetic, of losing time by “settling” and fetching, such
women as it will be our aim to procure can get through the
duty of seventy-two patients, although with the serious drawback
of their being in separate wards and on separate floors.</p>

<p>If, however, the Pavilion plan were so modified as to have
two pavilions end to end, with an intervening staircase, so
spacious and well ventilated as to cut off the ventilation of the
two wards on the same plane, then all the conditions as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
health, and facility of nursing and supervision, would be much
more easily obtained. Of this more hereafter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3.
Responsibility
of Nurse for
Discipline of
her Ward or
Wards&mdash;how
Modified in
Military
Hospitals.</div>

<p>3. As to the Nurse’s responsibility for the good order of
the three wards in a pavilion, supposing the three wards are
served by one Nurse, there must always be a clear difference
between this responsibility in the Head Nurse of
a Civil and a Military Hospital. The Civil Head Nurse,
whose assistants are all Nurses, who with herself are
under the Matron, is charged with, and responsible for, the
good order of the ward, and it becomes her duty, the moment
she finds herself unable to do this alone, at once to call in the
Steward, or equivalent Officer, in whose hands is the police
of the Hospital.</p>

<p>The Military Head-Nurse’s Assistants are Orderlies, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
men and soldiers, who, with the patients, are under military
discipline. Of this military discipline, the military power
from the Commandant down to the Non-Commissioned Officers
acting as Ward-Masters, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, is in charge; the duty of the
Military Nurse is, I apprehend, in case of any insubordination
which she cannot put down at once, to call in the Ward-Master
or equivalent, before calling in the superior Military or the
Surgical Officer; it being, however, well understood on all sides,
that she has the right of direct appeal to the superior Military
or the Surgical Officer, if the Ward-Master does not do his
duty, or in the event of a grave irregularity, if he is not at
hand, besides its being her duty to report such to the Matron,
if the case admits of being deferred till that can be done. It
is impossible to settle details until the regulations as to the
new Hospital Corps are fixed; and whatever regulations, whether
for Nurses or for Orderlies are made, some difficulty, and
much discretion will be inevitable and necessary in working
them. But it is necessary to bear in mind that whereas in
the Civil Hospital the Head Nurse, under the control of,
and responsible to, the Officers, including the Matron of the
Hospital, is solely in charge of both the nursing and the
discipline of her ward, both as to patients and as to Assistant
Nurses; in the Military Hospital, she is in charge of the
nursing, and the Ward-Master of the discipline, both of
patients and Orderlies. To be in charge of the nursing,
implies to have power to enforce discipline, but this i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>s rather,
in ordinary cases, to call in the military power, beginning
from the lowest or Ward-Master’s grade and reporting this
to the Matron, than to invoke herself the military superiors.
Therefore it would be well worth while trying how far it
would answer to serve the three wards by one Nurse, who, in
each ward where she successively is, is bound, on perceiving
any irregularity, to call in the Ward-Master, and, in contingencies,
to appeal directly to the Surgeon and the Captain of
Orderlies, and to make the discipline of the three wards the
charge of the Ward-Master, who is bound to go through the
wards when the Nurse is not in them. The Ward-Master, in
order to fulfil his charge, must enter all the wards, while the
Nurse is in one of them; so that the patients of one ward, who
may know that they are safe from the Nurse for half an hour
or more, as she is in another ward, know that they are not
safe from the Ward-Master.</p>

<p>In a military Hospital we must bear in mind that it is essential
that the discipline over patients and orderlies should be exercised
by men, and that the Ward-Masters must be the lowest
and immediate deposits of this power of discipline.</p>

<p>All these things must be settled with the concurrence of the
Director-General.</p>

<p>It is a great comfort that the Hospital staff returns to
soldiers. We shall get on infinitely better with them than we
could have done with the late Medical Staff Corps, though,
after all, in the long run, we should manage with them too. If
only God helps us with the sort of women required, thoroughly
efficient Nurses, laborious active women, discreet as well as
well-conducted, and aware (a little) of the sort of work and
place, they are in!&mdash;let us trust this to Him, when the time
comes, and depend upon it, to give each Nurse plenty to do
will become one great means of forming such women&mdash;provided,
which must be strenuously kept in view, they are made
to do it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. Importance
of Lifts.</div>

<p>4. It is very important to have the system of lifts throughout
the Hospital, although here, as throughout, the plan of
Pavilions renders them much more requisite, and makes them
work less efficiently than the block plan. Lifts, to carry meals
and medicine, linen, coals, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, to and from the first and
second floor wards, are very preferable to the Orderlies carryin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>g
them up and down. One sort of load ought certainly not to be
brought up and down by lifts, but to be carried up and down by
men, viz., coffins and the dead. Using the lift for this purpose
(as is done in one Civil Hospital) is on all and every account
thoroughly objectionable.</p>

<p>The system of lifts is the more important, because although
there is no objection to the washing of tea cups, drinking cups,
and medicine vessels at the sink in the scullery, it is certainly
neither necessary nor safe to wash the dinner dishes close to
the sick wards. By a little arrangement, the whole of these
could be removed by lifts to a scullery beside the kitchen, and
there cleansed and set aside for next day’s use.</p>

<div class="sidenote">III.&mdash;1.
Casualty Wards
for noisy and
offensive cases
should be
separate from
the ordinary
Wards, and
under a
completely-appointed
Staff
of their own&mdash;both
for
Sanitary and
administrative
reasons.</div>

<p>III.&mdash;1. Sanitary necessities can never be interfered with.
The concentrating offensive and noisy cases together, while
entirely separating them from each other, in a completely
appointed set of wards, is a far more efficient working thing
than appending a small ward to each ward.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s (a very admirable Hospital in very many things)
has a casualty ward (for such cases) for men and one, adjoining
but separate, for women, under the charge of one Sister. Baths
are in the wards.</p>

<p>Guy’s had the same provision with, however, the drawback
that there was not a Sister in charge, but a Nurse over other
Nurses, with higher pay, but not a Sister or Head Nurse.
However excellent such a Nurse may be, every ward <em>must</em> be
under the same regular government as is general in the Hospital,
if discipline and order are not to suffer. Every ward or
set of wards should be under a completely appointed staff.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew’s had a set of casualty wards, including two
of about ten beds each, several small wards of two and one bed
each, including two with gratings and other melancholy
necessary appliances to prevent extremely violent delirious
patients from becoming suicides. These wards were often
partially empty, never quite so. They were long served like
the casualty wards of Guy’s; but some years ago they were
placed under the charge of the Sister of the male operation
ward immediately above, who received in consequence a small
annual increase of wages.</p>

<p>London Hospital sent its <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>noisome, offensive, and extra-infectious
cases to its other wards&mdash;small wards for one patient
each, and, like Guy’s, not under the regular management of a
regular Head Nurse.</p>

<p>It most certainly appears that the plan of concentrating
these cases together, but with (as at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew’s)
small wards where extra-violent patients can be put separately,
the whole under one staff of Nurses, is far the best
working plan.</p>

<p>And for this reason. Occasionally, a very offensive case
requires little nursing beyond the fixed daily dressings, and
can lie quietly enough in his bed or ward. But noisy cases
almost always, and offensive cases generally, require close
watching. Now the moment we have a patient in a little
room at the end of the ward, it is our duty to go in and out
and see after him, and supposing him to be a violent, delirious
case, he is, unless under strong restraint, unsafe alone; and
even then the restraint requires looking to. In very many
cases the frequent inspection of Nurse and Orderlies would not
be enough, and the man ought to have a watcher.</p>

<p>We can never send one of the Orderlies of the ward, wanted
for its regular duty, to sit down in one of these little rooms;
and we can never keep a fixed extra Orderly idling about,
unless the little ward is inhabited. We must then fall back
upon extra Orderlies, put in when the case wants close watching&mdash;of
course not otherwise.</p>

<p>At night, also, the watching which suffices for the ward will
often not suffice for the extra case&mdash;and he must have a
watcher apart.</p>

<p>The plan of extra Orderlies or extra Nurses is a very bad
one, to be avoided as much and as long as possible; it very
seriously interferes with the discipline of wards.</p>

<p>Recollect that each offensive or extra-infectious case, put into
the little ward, ought to represent a great amount of separation
and care, which it will be difficult to secure. His mug,
utensils of all descriptions, bandages, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, ought to be washed
separately from those of the patients of the large ward. Is this
easily secured?</p>

<p>In the two Borough Hospitals they at once remove a case of
erysipelas or gangrene, occurring in any ward, erysipelas from
venereal wards included, into the casualty ward. In the two
other great Hospitals it is only when the erysipelas or gangre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>ne
becomes severe that the removal is made. Now at once to
remove these cases from the ordinary wards is very advantageous.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew’s larger wards for male and female casualty
cases, two small wards for two patients each, and two grated
wards for one each, are very efficient. The wards are all contiguous,
and, as has been said, under the charge of a remarkably
efficient Sister, who has charge also of the male operation ward
immediately above. The little casualty wards, of course, add
to the work, and greatly to the anxiety of watching; but certainly
violent delirium tremens’ cases, alone and in a secure
ward which can be darkened, appear often to quiet much
sooner than where several of these wretches lie shouting to
and at each other. Delirium tremens will never be a thing
unknown in a Military Hospital.</p>

<p>One such case in the little ward adjoining the Pavilion
Ward would be a heavy infliction on the severe cases in the
latter; the noise would be heard throughout it. And unless
the ward were properly secured, or unless the man were under
strong restraint&mdash;and then that would require constant looking
to&mdash;he would not be safe a moment alone; while the Orderly
was emptying slops or bringing in his dinner, something might
occur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Restraint or
Non-restraint
in Delirium
Tremens.</div>

<p>2. Restraint is again a thing which must be left to our masters,
and to them solely&mdash;but an ugly, sorrowful, little truth may
here be told. Restraining and non-restraining processes, and
their results may be seen, both where, in the same Hospital,
one or more of the Surgeons orders restraint never to be used
to his patients, however violent, and others order it to be used
in violent cases: and where the rule of the Hospital is to
restrain violent cases, removing the restraint so soon as the
paroxysm is over, or as soon as amelioration renders the sudden
return of paroxysms less likely. I am not speaking of lunatic
asylums, but of delirium, particularly delirium tremens, in
hospitals. Lunatics occasionally enter the Civil Hospitals, but,
of course, as soon as that supreme earthly misery is ascertained,
they are removed to the proper refuge. It is my humble
opinion and firm belief that mechanical restraint excites a
patient much less, and quiets him much sooner, than the
prolonged struggle with his attendant’s arms and hands, whi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>ch
<em>must</em> otherwise be resorted to.</p>

<p>The coercion apparatus ought also to be good, not cheap, and
always in perfect order. The least thing out of order either
causes pain, which when it can be avoided is cruel, or it endangers
the efficiency of the whole. The strength and cunning of
these patients resembles those of madmen, which for the time
being they are.</p>

<p>Restraint renders the usual complement of ward servants
able to manage many cases. Non-restraint means that some
person must stand or sit by or upon the patient’s bed, and hold
and struggle with him often for hours&mdash;also that generally
this person must be a stranger to the ward. Extra attendants
are most injurious to discipline. Could there be a set of
casualty or equivalent wards, with its own Head-Nurse, the
sick would gain much.</p>

<p>But if necessary to adopt the little ward with every
ward&mdash;in that case the Nurse must manage the three additional
patients&mdash;twenty-four or twenty-five are, indeed, too
few.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IV. Simplicity
of Construction
essential to
Discipline.</div>

<p>IV. In all Hospitals, let the construction be as simple as it
can be. Let its splendour be its lofty airy wards, with plenty of
windows; water in all due abundance on each floor; an ample,
not excessive, supply of linen, polished impervious walls and
ceilings, well-laid and bees-waxed oak floors, and a thorough
not excessive, supply of good apparatus of the various necessary
kinds. But every <em>unneeded</em> closet, scullery, sink, lobby,
represents both a place which must be cleaned, and which
must take hands and time to clean, and a hiding or skulking
place for patients or servants disposed to do wrong; and of
such no Hospital will ever be free. And every cornice, every
brass lock or handle, which could be replaced by a plain china
or ebony one; every decoration, or flourish, or ledge, on doors,
windows, tables, beds, presses, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, represents either a collection
of dust or a great waste of hands, time, and strength in unnecessary
cleaning and dusting. These are not crotchets, but
the result of close observation of the practical working of
these matters. Every five minutes wasted upon cleaning what
had better not have been there to be cleaned, is something taken
from and lost by the sick. Let the appurtenances of the wards
be simple and complete, but as plain and as undecorated as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
is possible to be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Polished
Walls.</div>

<p>Polished impervious walls and ceilings are of the first consequence
in Hospitals. It is perhaps hardly necessary to state
that, if Parian cement be used, it must not and need not be of
the kind lining the wards and corridors at Guy’s Hospital,
which is as rough as the roughest plaster, of a dark and dirty
colour, and which nothing could improve but being lime-washed
twice a-year; it should be polished like that used at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lariboisière</span>
Hospital at Paris, and of a pure white.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Covered
Exercising
Place.</div>

<p>In building a new Hospital, some covered arcade or some
place where the patients might take exercise in wet weather,
and where inspection could be exercised over them, without
fuss, is worth contriving. In <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s, the patients walk
under the covered arcades of the court.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reserve
Wards.</div>

<p>Both in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span> and in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité</span> Hospitals at Berlin there
are reserve wards,&mdash;or rather in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité</span> there is a reserve
Hospital, into which most of the sick are moved for six months
in the year, to change the air alternately of all the wards, which
during the time receive a thorough cleaning. Great stress is
laid at Berlin on thus providing, when building a new Hospital,
a certain reserve space, which obviates the necessity of
less efficient and far more costly steps afterwards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">V. Nurses’
Meals.</div>

<p>V. Let us, by all means, consider as settled, that the
Nurses’ food is sent them cooked. Possibly, in the long run,
the undoubted advantages of this plan will be found to be
over-balanced by its disadvantages; but let us begin by trying
it. I submit that their dinners, and possibly suppers, should
alone be sent them cooked, and that each Nurse should receive
a fixed weekly quantity of groceries, and a daily or two days’
allowance of bread.</p>

<p>For packing up the Nurse’s meals sent her from the
kitchen, a Vienna custom might be useful. Each Nurse to
have a long, strong, straw basket, properly named or numbered.
Some contain five dishes and covers, but two or three would
here be sufficient for every purpose, including an occasional
slice of pudding. The dishes strong tin, with a tin cover, and
if the Nurse prefers eating her dinner out of it rather than
the dignity of plates, and the trouble of washing them up, the
Matron should let her take hers her own way. If taken
by hand, two baskets of this sort can be carried with ease.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
But if the Matron, as a general procedure, sends each Nurse
a hot little dinner, of a good well-cooked portion of meat and
vegetables, one such dish and cover will do for one Nurse, and
three, five, or six can be accommodated out of the same
basket, or one large basket, carried by two men, would serve
all the Nurses round. The dishes should, in either case, be
numbered or named, not the Nurse’s name, but the ward.</p>

<p>A dish and cover of strong, coarse earthenware is used in
the Vienna Hospital, as a grander edition of dinner, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> The
tin ones keep warm without fire for a long time. If the meal
arrives when the Nurse cannot eat it, put by on the hob, or
some provision for warming in the scullery, it will keep warm
and good till she can eat it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VI.
Arrangements
for a Pavilion
served by one
Nurse.</div>

<p>VI. Supposing that we serve each Pavilion by one Nurse,
I submit that&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Nurse’s
Day-room.</div>

<p>1. The Nurse’s day-room should be on the ground floor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Ward-Master’s
Sleeping-room.</div>

<p>2. The Ward-Master should sleep in his room on the second
or highest floor; should the Nurses sleep in the Pavilion, the
Ward-Master should still sleep in it.</p>

<p>In the event of the Pavilions being arranged end to end, as
already suggested, the difficulty in regard to Nurses’ and Ward-Masters’
rooms would be materially diminished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Where
should
Orderlies
Sleep?</div>

<p>3. I think, but am not sure, that the Orderlies had better
sleep away from their wards, but I would leave this to be
settled by the Doctors. In cases of sudden outbursts of
danger, delirium, or drunkenness, from the results of concealed
spirits, and of the Surgeon being sent for, it is useful to have,
at once, other than the Night Orderly at hand. And a part of
what has been said as to the importance of the Head Nurse
sleeping near her ward, applies to the Orderlies. Yet there are
important reasons why the Orderlies should not be or feel
too much at home in their wards; and if the authorities are
disposed to try the plan of lodging the Orderlies together, away
from their wards, they are probably right, though I should
not be surprised if, after a fair trial, it were found better to
revert to the having them near the ward. The Pavilion Plan,
which, on the one hand, gives all concerned more liberty of
doing wrong than the block plan, and which, on the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
renders it more difficult to call in help, whether of supervisor
or of Orderlies, if help is suddenly wanted in the night, makes
it the more desirable to let the authorities take quite their own
way, as to this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. Where
should
Orderlies
Dine?</div>

<p>4. I think the Orderlies had better have their cooked meals
sent them into the wards. Of course, they can only eat together
in detachments; but in many cases, the absence of even
one of the Orderlies would be very inconvenient. Perhaps just
as the bell rings to summon to the common meal, something is
going on which requires all the ward service; the man either
goes late to a cold dinner, or goes away just when he is wanted.
If his dinner is brought to him in one of these emergencies, it
is put by to keep warm till it is over. Regularity as to meals,
as far as possible, should be strictly attended to; and is, in all
well-regulated wards: and it is well, where, as in some Hospitals,
there is a fixed hour for meals; but it would seem better
that the meals should come to the ward servants than the ward
servants go to their meals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5. Should
Orderlies be
brought
together?</div>

<p>5. In the case of Civil Hospitals served by women, it is
very important that each Head-Nurse, and each set of Assistant-Nurses,
should sleep, eat, and live in the ward and its
appertaining rooms, and not assemble together more than can
be avoided. With Orderlies the case is partly different. Still
I would not unnecessarily bring them all together, any more
than allow them to be too much at home in their wards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6. Should
Orderlies have
a Day-room in
Pavilion?</div>

<p>6. If the Orderlies do not sleep in the Pavilion they should
not have a day-room.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7. Scullery to
each Ward.</div>

<p>7. To each ward should be attached a scullery, small, but not
too small, which only muddles things and work, well provided
with cold, and, if possible, with warm water; and it should be
law that no patient enters the scullery unless sent there by
the Nurse to help in washing up, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; and, as a rule, they
ought not to be sent there. Make them useful in the ward;
keep the scullery for the Nurse and Orderlies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8. What should
be done in the
Scullery?</div>

<p>8. From this scullery let the Nurse get the water she requires&mdash;Orderlies
ditto.</p>

<p>Let the Orderlies eat their meals in it, if they do not eat
them away from the ward. The food of the Orderlies is generally
different from that of most of the patients, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
answers better for them to eat their meals not under the noses
of the patients. In emergencies, of no rare occurrence, the
Orderly must watch a patient and eat his dinner at the same
time, and so must the Nurse; but, as a rule, it is undoubtedly
better that ward-servants should not eat under the observation
of the patients.</p>

<p>In the scullery all the cleaning must take place, which is not
done in the lavatory.</p>

<p>In the scullery extras are to be warmed, drinks ditto, hot-bricks
heated, water-bottles filled, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, and none of
these things are to be done at the ward-fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poultice-making.</div>

<p>On the other hand, there is no way so good of making poultices,
a thing humble but important, as for the Nurse to stand
at a small table in front of the ward-fire, to make the poultices
there, spread them, and forthwith apply them.</p>

<p>Sometimes in a large ward, where the Surgeon orders them
extensively, a large iron pot is filled with poultice, and then
quickly spread and applied. Sometimes the pot is filled and
the poultices spread in the scullery or kitchen, to avoid the
mess in the ward. When a number of poultices are thus
spread away from the sight of the patients, even by very clever
Nurses, some arrive too large, or too small, or too broad, or
too narrow; and either the poultice has to be returned, or, as
of course usually takes place, to be put on the wound it does
not fit.</p>

<p>I would not trust any Nurse, including myself, to make a
number of poultices of the right size, unless within sight of
the patients. Rather than do this it is better to make the
poultice-pot (wood does not hold heat, this must be of iron),
in the scullery, to take it into the ward, and there spread and
apply the poultices.</p>

<p>But a large iron pot of linseed poultice seldom contains the
article nearly so well made, as when made in smaller consecutive
quantities in a wooden bowl. The bowl does not keep warm
above a certain time. Where the poultice is made in a mass,
even by very clever Nurses, it never is so well made as when
the Nurse makes the poultices in the wooden bowl. These
must be forthwith spread, applied, and the bowl re-filled, if
more are wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>This is another reason why the person who washes the wound
should also make the poultice, as also why the Orderlies should
clean the ward, why the Nurse should as far as possible be relieved
of all “mental labour,” and why kept as much as possible to
“manual labour.” All severe wounds she should wash and
dress herself, and many a wound becomes severe, when the
patient is allowed to fiddle over it himself. Some wounds will
not bear being left uncovered, and of course in some cases the
Nurse will wash the wound, and immediately afterwards apply
the poultice. In general, the Surgeon will consider the wounds
take no harm from being washed all round, and then poulticed all
round. This requires not to be over-hurried, and not to lose a
moment’s time. A careful Nurse will never apply a poultice
without having first seen the wound: carelessness, haste,
idleness, over-work, and prudery, each and all produce very
sorry results as to this.</p>

<p>I think, therefore, poultices should be made in the ward, and
immediately after the table cleared away, and the slight mess
also. In some Hospitals they place a straw carpet just round
the table, and also carry it to any bed which requires an extra
mess in dressing or cleaning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9. Presses in
Ward.</div>

<p>9. A regular store closet is hardly desirable. A good
arrangement is this:&mdash;</p>

<p>At the end of the ward, nearest the Nurse’s room, or the
ward-door, a large press for linen.</p>

<p>By it or opposite it another press, for stimulants, dangerous
medicines, stock medicines, such as castor oil and one or two
others which are always to be at hand, though not ordered for
any particular case, stock lotions (as few as possible), lint, old
soft linen, stronger but not coarse ditto for pads, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, cotton
wool, tow, oilskin, splints and pads, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Of all these
things, the Nurse should always have a certain reserve on
hand.</p>

<p>It will be well worth while to see that these presses are made
commodiously for their purpose. The linen press should have
broad deep shelves, and the different kinds of things should be
sorted apart; the other press should have broad deep shelves
for the heavier things, and separate shelves for the bottles;
the stimulants by themselves in one row, the stock medicines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in another, unless these and the stock laudanum were together,
but they are better apart, and the dangerous things upon
the topmost shelf; another row for sweet oil, mustard, stock
lotions, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, another row for ointments. Each bottle and pot
to be distinctly labelled in whatever is reckoned the most
lasting manner; opinions differ as to labels and letters cut
in the glass. The latter are boring by night, if something is
suddenly wanted, and it is just then that mistakes are to be
guarded against. A strong clear <span class="smcap">PRINTED</span> label, securely
fastened to the bottle, is preferable, to be renewed when necessary,
as Orderlies’ thumbs even while holding a bottle, if the
Nurse’s hands are on the bed, wear labels out. There is a
great saving of time and of chance of mistakes effected by
clearly printing the directions for the administration of medicine,
“once,” “twice a day,” “every three hours,” <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, and
affixing them to each medicine bottle.</p>

<p>Of both these presses the Nurse should have the key or keys.
One key might do for both, but it may be best to have two
keys.</p>

<p>It is a very good plan where the shape of all medicine bottles
and of those for liniments is distinctly different; and where,
<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, square bottles are used for poisons, or blue bottles for
poisons, and square for lotions.</p>

<p>A small narrow shelf over each patient’s bed, or over his
locker, solely for his medicines and wine. When these are on
the locker it is less convenient. Where the medicines are
not dangerous, it is better to have them thus at each bed,
than concentrated away from the beds. Dangerous medicines
should never be left at a patient’s bed.</p>

<p>The two presses will answer all demands. As, however, it
does not do not to have a supply of everything that may be
wanted always in readiness, a stand or table in the ward should
have upon it a small supply of whatever may be suddenly
wanted&mdash;a little lint, linen, tow, and two or three vessels. The
supply of lint, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, to be small enough for the Nurse to keep
account of it, and for the patients to know that account is
kept of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Apparat</span>” in
German
Hospitals.</div>

<p>In constant daily use in the surgical wards of the great
Vienna Hospital is a thing called in Teutonic style “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Apparat</span>.”
The Nurse carries it round for herself, when preparing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>nd
dressing the patients, and carries it after the Surgeon when he
makes his rounds. The system of both dressing and washing is
in some respects so different from the English one, that the
fittings would vary.</p>

<p>This concentration of what is wanted for dressing and
washing wounds, and for attending the Surgeon in his
inspection of them, and of what is at once wanted on any
bleeding, fit, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, is very useful; all the more from its being in
a compact portable form, which can be thus successively carried
to each bed. An English carpenter would make a lighter and
handier thing. Brass basins, which are there used, are not
desirable. Of course, one must be most especially anxious not
to introduce any novelty, particularly any foreign novelty, faster
than can be avoided, and we may consider it better either
to leave the general system unaltered of rushing on some
emergency to the dressing table drawer, or closet, and thence
bringing successively the things wanted, or at all events not to
extend concentration further than the excellent plan, so far as it
goes, of the London Hospital, where each Head Nurse attends
the Surgeons with a large basket in her hand, containing most
of the dressings required, spunges, and one or two little matters
also usefully at hand. The <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">apparat</i> has the advantage of carrying
with itself the basins used for washing. In the Military
Hospital of Vienna a tray attends each Surgeon, without
basins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">10. Nurse’s
Room.</div>

<p>10. It is important to have the Nurse’s room opening
at once into the ward, and, upon the whole, I should
incline to its having but one door, although it may be thought
better there should be a second, so that she can leave her room
without being seen to do so by the patients. Also, by all
means, let the scullery be opposite the Nurse’s room, and not
between the ward and the room. As an invariable Hospital
rule, rather more than elsewhere in Military Hospitals, publicity
may be considered to be a very great police, and a still greater
protection. It is far better that twenty-four patients should
see the Nurse’s door than one or none; and that her room
should open full upon the ward than into an intervening
scullery.</p>

<p>In contem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>plating a Military Hospital, we contemplate a
place through which, one year with another, all characters,
including a few of the vilest, pass. These are not theoretical
matters. The more repulsive the subject, the more prevention
is better than cure. Guard against too many closets, sinks,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lavatory.</div>

<p>At the end of the ward there should be a lavatory,
with a row, or two opposite rows, of white earthenware
basins fixed in a stand, with outlet tubes and plugs: each basin
should have a hot and cold water-pipe: and there should be not
less than one to each four beds. There should also be in the
lavatory a hot and cold water-pipe, from which a portable
bath can be filled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Water-closet.</div>

<p>At the furthest end of the ward should be a water-closet,
with not less than one soil-pan to each eight beds: and
white earthen or porcelain urinals in the same proportion.
In the London Civil Hospitals water-closets are now in
general use throughout the wards, but not in all of the
great Hospitals. In all the Civil Hospitals, it is usual that
the patients’ water-closets have no inside bolt or lock, and that
there is only accommodation for one inside. In some London
Civil Hospitals the male patients, able to take exercise, are
expected to make use of urinals out of doors. These matters
one, two, or three experienced army surgeons had better
pronounce upon; other things are to be considered than the
recommendations of architect, plumber, or even sanitarian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sink.</div>

<p>There is in a Berlin Hospital a very useful piece of prosaic
apparatus&mdash;adjoining the water-closet, a sink, with a high,
large, deep, round, pierced basin of stone, above a <em>large</em> hole,
into which the contents of a bed-pan can be at once emptied,
and from which the bed-pan is at once effectually cleansed.
Adjoining this is a sink into which all other slops are emptied.
In mentioning this pierced basin or sink solely for emptying
and cleansing bed-pans, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, which is used at the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span>
Hospital at Berlin, and is far better than emptying
the said vessels into the often-occupied water-closet, and
then cleansing them in an awkward fashion between the
water-closet and the sink, it is necessary to add that
the cock ought to extend far enough over the sink for the
bed-pan, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, to be thoroughly cleansed by a stream of water
falling directly into it. The Nurse stands at the sink, empties
the pail, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, in it, without fear of splashing, and rinses <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>and
fills it, without stirring from the place. Now this absence of
splashing water and of moving about from sink to pump, or
cock, saves mess and time. The oblong sink, usual in England,
has by no means the same advantages.</p>

<p>(The partition containing the sink would be an appropriate
receptacle for the bed-pans to hang by hooks or nails on the
wall pending their use.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baths.</div>

<p>In Civil Hospitals, two baths, in an airy closet at
the end of the ward, to be locked at all times when
not in actual use, are a very great advantage. Bringing a bath
into a ward, which in many urgent cases must be done when
the baths are distant, is a messing discomfort. Still it had
better be left to surgeons to say whether, in Military Hospitals,
it would not be preferable to have, in each ward, only a
portable bath, on wheels, covered with india-rubber, to be
brought into the ward for any urgent case; and to take
all the men able to walk, or safely to be carried, to the
Hospital baths. Of these, some trustworthy, or intended and
supposed to be trustworthy, man, who ought to rank as a non-commissioned
officer, should have charge. An intelligent and
respectable-looking man, a serjeant, has charge of the baths in
the Garrison Hospital at Vienna.</p>

<p>In a great London Civil Hospital, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s, it is the
very admirable practice for each patient (of course with necessary
exceptions) to be bathed on his or her admission. The
Sisters are responsible for examining each woman in the bath,
which is within the female wards, and for at once reporting before
suffering them to go to bed, any case of suspected pregnancy,
syphilis, or contagious disease. A man does the same for the
men, who are bathed apart from the wards. This arrangement
is an excellent one. On the other hand, severe cases, just able
to be carried to baths, get no good by going through the air,
and being jolted up and down stairs.</p>

<p>In planning a Military Hospital, in which the service of
women is to be introduced, it is important to obtain the advice
of experienced Army Surgeons as to the arrangement of
appurtenances of the wards to be used by the patients alone.
Endeavour to prevent the system of holes and corners. It is
best that the Nurse’s door should command the view of those
who come in or out of the lavatory, and in or out of the wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>ter-closet.
This whole section is both ugly and important.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11. Summary.</div>

<p>11. To sum up. I think it would work the best to have no
store-closet, only two well-appointed presses, by which a certain
amount of cleaning is saved, and a corner avoided.</p>

<p>Could two cupboards or presses in the wall be arranged for the
ward linen and the ward stores, it would be preferable to
presses placed against the walls. Take care, however, that
the wall is sufficiently thick, so that the presses are not damp,
and if this cannot be provided against, keep to presses separate
from the wall.</p>

<p>Believe that all this is neither theory nor fidget&mdash;but
practice.</p>

<p>The furthest end of the ward should contain a lavatory,
a water-closet, and the pierced basin for emptying and cleaning
bed-pans is a very useful thing. At the other end of
the ward, the Nurse’s little room, her door opening full
upon the ward. If the upper half were of glass, with a
curtain before it, allowing the Nurse to see the ward without
being seen, it would be all the more useful. At <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s,
a window opens into the ward, the Sister drawing a blind
when she chooses, and a door opens into the passage, just
within the ward doors, opposite the scullery, so that the
Sister enters the scullery, in which there is a water-closet, for
the accommodation of herself and Nurses, without traversing
her ward. Whether door or window, the Nurse should see
at once all that is going on in her ward. I prefer a door;
yet, if there is to be a ward for one, it may be best and
most central to have the Nurse’s window on the large ward,
and her door open on the passage. Opposite the Nurse’s
room should be a scullery, not too small. The scullery should
be well provided with cold, and, if possible, warm water.</p>

<p>If a supply of hot water can be obtained by turning a cock,
this is best. Provision should be made in the ward scullery for
keeping poultices warm which is every now and then wanted.
It is not right to wash eating-vessels and poultice pans, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, in
the same sink; and this should be considered in arranging
the scullery. If each ward washes its own bandages, which
it ought not to do, the second sink will come in usefully for
this. It is worth while, in enforcing extreme simplicity,
to prevent jumbling together eating-vessels and things for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
wounds and sores. Sinks are infinitely most handy when made
deep, somewhat in the shape of broad round basins, with hole
at bottom; it saves much splashing and mess; the cock to
overhang full the middle of the sink. The Wall against the
sink should have some protection.</p>

<p>Such a scullery, with complete efficient simple apparatus for
its various purposes, places for washing up and cleaning, and
for ward purposes and cookery, so that the Nurse can warm
the drinks, prepare fomentations, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, without jostling the
Orderlies, who are washing up or cleaning, will be a very
great comfort, simplification, and promoter of order, cleanliness,
efficiency, and work. At one corner a decent little table for
Orderlies’ meals, above it their separate safes for their bread,
cold rations, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; each to have and keep his key; each to
have his locker.</p>

<p>Each floor and ward will require a scullery. It is far
better for each ward to contain its own appointments&mdash;and
all the other stores to be together, apart. On the second floor
might be the Ward-Master’s room; <i>vice</i> the Nurse’s room.</p>

<div class="sidenote">12. Nurses’
Sleeping
Quarters.</div>

<p>12. Nurses’ quarters, if we are driven to their not sleeping
near their wards, should be adjoining the Matron’s two rooms,
and separate water-closet, in a part of the Hospital as central as
can be managed without trespassing on our betters. I would
simplify these quarters as much as possible&mdash;either a series of
very small rooms, or one great space partitioned off each into a
little cell, with a window, bed, washing table, chest of drawers,
and a very small wardrobe, with space to hang up three or
four gowns, deep enough for another row for shawl, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, at top
a shelf for bonnet and caps, at bottom a deep drawer for
boots and shoes. These things will be a convenient riddance
to the chest of drawers, and comfort to the women. In each
cell very strong hooks to hang up and air a little gowns taken
off at night, and one or two chairs. The nurses must wash
their hands, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, in the rooms off their wards, and I think it
must be understood as a rule that they leave their quarters in
the morning and return to them at night. Optional carpet.</p>

<p>Each cell to be numbered either with number or with name
of Pavilion. Opposite this space a small lumber room, wherein
each nurse may deposit her box, thereby hindering dissemination
of bugs. Opposite also a running open cupboard, with partitio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>ns
numbered or named as rooms, containing each Nurse’s
broom, dustpan, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, each with a key.</p>

<p>Also pump, sink, water closet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Furnishing.</div>

<p>When furnishing begins, it will be well worth while to see
that all articles of furniture, whether for wards or Nurse’s
quarters, admit of being easily swept and scrubbed underneath,
and swept and dusted at top. Chests of drawers, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, with
too narrow space between bottom and ground, harbour dust,
or sadly waste a few precious minutes in the most busy part
of every day. As few high pieces of furniture as possible, to
gather dust and be out of easy reach; as few as possible of
cumbrous articles difficult to move from the wall, to sweep
and dust behind, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>There ought to be, near the Superintendent’s quarters,
one or two small rooms, where, necessity occurring, sick
Nurses might be lodged. We cannot hope always to escape
having sick Nurses; and there would be serious objection in a
Military Hospital, where only one Nurse sleeps on each floor, to
having the Nurse ill in her room for more than 2 or 3 days at the
outside. Or there might be one good-sized airy room, with two
or three dark washable curtains dividing it into little dormitories,
so that one Nurse, whom the Superintendent must engage and
watch, could attend them all. And as Her Majesty’s Nurses
must have allowed them such decent comfort as can be, but no
fastidiousness, I think the cubicles in one room would be best.
Not to be called so, however, by any means, as it would sound
Latin and “Puseyitical.” The Nurse’s ward to be locked and
key kept by Superintendent, except when tenanted. I should
hope three beds would answer thoroughly, as well as that the
ward would be empty eleven months out of the twelve.</p>

<p>Considering the awkwardness of illness among Nurses,
when it did occur in a Military Hospital, it would be worth while
that, adjoining the little ward, there should be a little room for
any one infectious case which might occur; <i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, supposing one
Nurse ill in the ward with bronchitis, it would not do to put
another with small-pox into the ward,&mdash;at least it would be
very impolitic. The ward should have a water-closet and a
little sink of its own, and a little cell, but with window and
fireplace, for the attending Nurse to lie down in. When not
used, once a month’s, or week’s at the most, cleaning by a cha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>rwoman
would be enough. It should be always clean and
ready for use. In the Civil Hospitals, few years pass without
sundry Head-Nurses and Nurses dying, not a few Nurses
being warded, and sundry Head-Nurses ill in their rooms. The
peculiarity of Military Hospitals makes this little preparation
for what is certain every now and then to occur seem desirable
and economical; to hire lodgings in the neighbouring town
would be in all ways a worse plan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">13.
Classification
of Cases.</div>

<p>13. Endeavour, if possible, to obtain a classification of the
severe and non-severe cases, and let the Nurses be only
appointed to the wards of severe cases. The convalescent
cases to be successively removed to the convalescent pavilions,
whether they bear or not that name. No convalescent ward
in any of the floors of the Pavilions to be served by Nurses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">14. Nurses to
be called by the
Names of their
Wards.</div>

<p>14. It will be found excellent in many respects not to allow
the Nurses’ names to be used in the ward of the Hospital, or
among each other, so far as the Matron takes cognizance of.
In the great London Hospitals the name of a Nurse is never
heard, except occasionally to each other as a solace, partly very
natural, partly harmless vanity. She is Sister or Nurse of
such and such a ward. In hasty parlance she is distinguished
from the others by the name of the ward only. In it she is
always addressed as Sister or Nurse.</p>

<p>Thus a Sister of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s Hospital, whose services in
the War Hospitals of the East I can never forget, was always
at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s spoken of out of her ward as Sister of George,
or, more commonly, Sister George; and spoken to quickly or
called to in a hurry as George.</p>

<p>All this, the only course of all the great and, I believe, of
the smaller London Hospitals, works excellently, in many
ways.</p>

<div class="sidenote">15. Foul Linen&mdash;how
to be
Disposed of.</div>

<p>15. Arrangements should be made that foul linen remains
for the least possible time out of the laundry. As regards the
laundry deposits, the best plan is that of the London Hospital,
where each ward has a bin of its own marked accordingly. To
similar bins all the foul linen should be, at least, daily carried,
unless it is judged best to receive and wash all the linen in a
heap, returning numbers only to each ward. The former plan
is preferable. In any case the linen of the “foul wards” should
be received and washed apart. During the time, which ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to be as short as possible, between dirty linen leaving the
patients and reaching the bin or bins, a large box in the scullery
is making the best of a bad business&mdash;the presence of foul
Hospital linen always is that&mdash;and is preferable to a closet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16. Washing
Bandages.</div>

<p>16. Washing bandages, a very important thing. Shall a
washerwoman be told off for that particular purpose? or shall
the Orderlies of each ward do it <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">alla meglio</i>? The former is
the better plan; if not adopted, the Nurse must see well to
the matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17. Splints&mdash;Bandages,
Lint,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, where to
be kept.</div>

<p>17. It would depend upon what sort of work is usually
going on in the Surgical Wards of a Military Hospital in peace
whether it will be worth either a press with glass front, in
which splints, pads, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, are excellently arranged, as at
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew’s; or the pad-basket and splint-rack, which
are also excellent, provided in London Hospital. The splint-rack,
enabling the Surgeon at once to see and choose of all shapes
and sizes, is perhaps only suited for an accident ward, and would
be out of place in a military ward in peace. It may be better
to have these stores entirely in some dispenser’s or store-keeper’s
jurisdiction, and to let the Nurse confine herself to
padding, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, any splint sent by the Surgeon into the ward.
Let our masters take exactly their own way about this.</p>

<p>Bandages, lint, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> should perhaps rest entirely
with the Dispenser, otherwise it would be useful in the
greater Hospitals, to have under the Matron a Nurse
charged with preparing them and giving them out, writing in
a book the date, amount of each, and the ward they are given
to. In a small Hospital the Matron could do this herself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cotton Lint
never to be
used.</div>

<p>While speaking of lint, it seems a duty to state that, in some
of the Military Hospitals, in certain County and even London
Hospitals, and also in Workhouses, and in the practice of private
Surgeons, a preparation of cotton has been recently substituted
in the dressing of wounds for <i>charpie</i> or Surgeons’ lint, properly
so called. So miserable an economy at the expense of the
sick is not adopted in several, at least, of the London endowed
Hospitals, probably in none. For all purposes for which lint
is necessary cotton fibre should be totally disused, in the army
and everywhere else. It is irritating and injurious to wounds.
It increases human suffering; it delays patients in Hospital,
and, in doing so, of course, increases the cost which such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
substitution has been intended to reduce. Nurses should be
particularly careful never to use this material, which is easily
distinguished, even by the touch. Any Surgeon may tell the
best of it from lint by submitting it to microscopic examination,
and on doing so he will readily discover that characteristic
of cotton fibre which renders it so ill adapted for surgical
dressings. It does not absorb the discharges from wounds, as
linen lint does. The fibre is ragged instead of being smooth,
and it is apt to become matted together, and to adhere to the
surface and edges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18.
Classification
of Women.</div>

<p>18. It is essential to have as few women as can efficiently do
their work. Supposing the Hospital were for one thousand
patients, not taking into account that some wards would probably
be foul wards, where I earnestly hope female service will
not be, at present at all events, introduced, and that some
wards would be for slight or convalescent cases, where I hope
it never will be&mdash;supposing each Nurse served seventy-five
patients, supposing one Nurse, at the very least, was told off
for the linen, fourteen or fifteen Nurses would serve the
Hospital. I conclude the Matron to have no cognizance of the
laundry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superintendent’s
Store
room.</div>

<p>The Superintendent<a name="Anchor_18" id="Anchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">[18]</a> will require a store room, or at least
a store closet, and hers should be well appointed. It would
depend upon the other arrangements of the quarters, whether
the world in general, when sent for to fetch what it wanted,
enter from the same side as the door of the Superintendent’s
bed-room, or from the other side. And it would depend upon
the nature and amount of stores of which she had charge, in the
larger Military Hospitals, whether or not she should have a
Nurse told off for this also. Economy is essential; but useless
fiddling over every duster or scrubbing-flannel given out, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, sadly hinders the Matron’s time from more important
things.</p>

<p>Housekeepers must be avoided, and every woman must
have a distinct and sufficient share of work, and each be distinctly
and equally under the Matron. Still it would be ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>vantageous
if we could from the first include in the staff of
Nurses for the larger Hospitals, one or two places which could
be filled by efficient persons who yet were unfitted for the
ward work, which calling will be, and ought to be, laborious
and wearing enough. Many a woman would never do to look
after a Pavilion and seventy-five men; who yet, in charge of
linen or stores, would be most valuable, and influence most
beneficially the Nurses, whom yet she might be unfit to govern.
The system of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sœurs de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Vincent</span>, who, in theory and
fact, subject entirely to the will of the Superiors in general
practice, are yet selected and trained for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">spécialités</span>, who remain
long in these <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">spécialités</span>, which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">spécialités</span> include such requiring
more or less of physical strength, seems to be one giving many
useful hints for us.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Addenda as to Mixed Nursing by Nurses and Orderlies
in Military Hospitals on the Double Pavilion Plan.</span></h2>
<h3 title="" class="faux"><span class="smcap">Orderlies’ Duties</span></h3>

<p>I. After much anxious thought, re-consideration of all
things, and pondering, I submit&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That three Orderlies will efficiently serve a ward of from
28 to 30 patients, including night-duty.</p>

<p>2. That each of two wards of 30 each, should there be two
such under the same Head Nurse, on the same flat, ought to be
entirely separate in all other respects.</p>

<p>3. That if night-duty be required, each such ward should
have an Orderly on night-duty.</p>

<p>4. That each such ward should have a scullery.</p>

<p>With regard to these questions, I further submit&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Economy of hands, combined with efficiency of service,
is an urgent thing in all Hospitals; most of all in Military
Hospitals,</p>

<p>On the score of expense;</p>

<p>On that of efficiency of inspection;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p class="sub">From the nature of Military Hospitals, where the aim should
be throughout to combine great simplicity with thorough
efficiency;</p>

<p class="sub">From the importance of training the staff, male and female,
of Military Hospitals, for service in War Hospitals,
where every man or woman who can be spared is better
away.</p>

<p>2. Yet economy of hands, carried too far, becomes, like all
other such economies, penny wise and pound foolish.</p>

<p>3. Without doubt, large wards can be efficiently served by
fewer hands than small or moderate wards. But, as sanitary
considerations limit the size of wards to from 24 to 30 patients,
let us make this the basis of all calculation.</p>

<p>4. The more it is considered, the more essential it appears,
to train Nurses, from the first, to do efficiently a great deal of
work. A small staff of respectable, laborious, and thoroughly
efficient women seems the thing to be aimed at; whether considering
Military Hospitals by themselves, or as a training-school
for Hospital war-service.</p>

<p>5. It would be better to give each Nurse one great ward; but
wards above a certain size are inadmissible for sanitary reasons.</p>

<p>6. The care of 24 to 30 patients is not sufficient duty, by a
great deal, for a Nurse.</p>

<p>7. Therefore, upon the whole, and as decidedly the lesser of
two evils, I recommend assigning to each Nurse two wards.</p>

<p>8. It is less difficult, and less objectionable, that she should
have charge of two wards on one floor, than of two wards on
two floors.</p>

<p>9. As regards the Nurse, I recommend therefore, upon the
whole, to give each Nurse the charge of two wards of 30 men
each; the wards to be on the same floor; but, except as being
under the same Head Nurse, entirely separate.</p>

<p>10. It is important to repeat that the Nurse (who is Head
Nurse), will be set free of two things, which consume much of
a Civil Head Nurse’s time.</p>

<p>(1). “Settling the diets,” and fetching, besides waiting for,
portions of those diets (<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i> wine) and medicine.</p>

<p>(2). Distribution of Diets.&mdash;It is quite possible that, in no
long time, it may be found desirable to assign this duty to the
Nurse. But it would be better to try to have it efficiently,
which implies honestly, discharged by the Ward-Master. It
will relieve the Nurse daily of considerable time; and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
charges the Ward-Master with a definite duty which he can
perform. The more he has defined duties, the less he will be
inclined to fidget and disturb the Nurse. He is pretty certain
to do this; but definite duties will diminish the tendency.</p>

<p>I should avoid giving the Ward-Masters too few wards.
Otherwise they will make themselves insufferable obstructions,
one way or another, to the Nurses. I should say that each
Ward-Master, in charge of a Pavilion of six wards of 30 each,
besides the small wards for one, would not have at all too much
to do. Where there are no Nurses, the Ward-Master should
have Assistant Ward-Masters in their place.</p>

<p>N.B. Wine might be treated as medicine, and, as such, delivered
by the Nurse. Wine and medicine are usually, in the
Civil Hospitals, given from the Apothecary’s shop at the same
time. Or it might be considered desirable to leave this duty
to the Ward-Master. In either case, it will never do to serve
a bad case at once with all his wine, and either to let him
stupify himself by swallowing it at once to make sure that he
has it; or to set it by his bed-side for the flies to spoil it, or for
a dishonest comrade, or here and there an Orderly, to drink
it. The Nurse should receive, whether directly or from the
Ward-Master, the wine of such patients, and should administer
it in successive small fresh portions. The intelligent administration
of wine ordered to bad cases is one of those momentous
<i>minutiæ</i> by which, I do believe, and believe more and more,
many lives are, by God’s blessing, annually saved in English
Hospitals which would be lost elsewhere. Of course the only
Regulation about wine should be to specify whether the Ward-Master
or the Nurse should administer it.</p>

<p>11. Relieved of the loss of time incurred by fetching and
waiting, and relieved at starting, at all events, and we will hope
permanently, of the time consumed in distributing the diets,
I certainly consider that a Nurse of the class of which, please
God, Her Majesty’s must all be, (strong, laborious, active, and
conscientious women,) can efficiently serve two wards of 30
men each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<p class="neohead"><i>Orderlies.</i></p>

<p>12. I should prefer wards of 30 each to wards of 25 each.</p>

<p>13. In forming rules for the proportion of Orderlies to sick,
it is important to consider that the duty varies extremely
according to the appurtenances of the ward.</p>

<p>14. I consider extreme plainness and simplicity to be proper
and indispensable to a Military Hospital. Let us take for
granted (and may it prove correct to do so), that in none of
Her Majesty’s Hospitals Orderlies’ time will be wasted in
cleaning any ornamental things, whether unnecessary furniture,
flourishes, or cornices, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, on necessary furniture; supernumerary
shelves, nooks and corners, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Once provided,
all these things must be carefully and constantly cleaned, or
they become receptacles of dust and breeders of fleas; and to
clean them involves enormous waste of time. A few minutes
daily wasted on each of many things, make an enormous sum.</p>

<p>15. But it is very true economy to supply, if possible&mdash;which
in old buildings it often is not&mdash;every ward of every
hospital with a constant supply of water, (taking care that it
is not wasted by mischievous or childish patients); and to
give every ward of every Hospital the use, under proper control,
of a lift by which, at fixed hours, food, medicine, linen
and fuel are brought into the wards.</p>

<p>Believe that this is not theory, but the result of practical
observation, much extended.</p>

<p>16. Now, these two things&mdash;supply of water (if hot and cold
so much the better, and supply of water imports, of course,
the appliance for getting rid of it, and of the contents of bed-pans,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, by one or more sinks) and the use of lifts can
be applied to a new Hospital; can possibly, not certainly, be
applied to some of the old Hospitals within the Kingdom,&mdash;can
certainly not be applied to many of the Army Hospitals
abroad.</p>

<p>17. Upon an average, these two things make the difference
of one Orderly’s duty to a ward of 30 men.</p>

<p>18. And a ward of 30 men, so supplied, would be efficiently
served by half a nurse and three Orderlies, including night-duty.</p>

<p>19. Without these two things (it is a mere comparative
question as to loss of time and absence of thorough cleanliness,
whether the water is brought from a pump in the court,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
or a stream some hundred yards off, above or below), and many,
if not most, Army Hospitals abroad, must always remain
without these two things, I consider that one Orderly to
every seven patients will not be too much; while it is certain
that, other things being equal, the ward with the appliances
and the three Orderlies will be better served than the ward
without the appliances and with the four Orderlies. Where
there is no Nurse, one Orderly for 7 patients will always be
advisable.</p>

<p>In these memoranda as to Orderlies’ work, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, no notice
whatever has been taken of the possible abolition of scrubbing,
because it does not do to count unhatched chickens.
If, however, that formidable weekly business could be got rid
of, as well as the bi-weekly or daily washings of bed-head-floors,
<abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> the labour of the Orderlies would be, without
underrating that required for keeping oiled floors cleaned, very
materially lightened.</p>

<p class="neohead"><i>Night-duty of Orderlies.</i></p>

<p>20. Convalescent wards, which will be of great use in many
ways, will be of use here. With them Nurses will have nothing
to do. It is possible enough that, in course of time, the
Medical Officers will desire to have Nurses there, and that it
may be useful to place there elderly, still efficient Nurses;
but let this come or not as it will, and let us keep quite
clear of them, at all events, till the Nursing-service be tried
and established in Army Hospitals. In these wards, night-duty
will probably be quite unnecessary, though in that case either
an Orderly or Assistant Ward-Master ought to sleep at hand;
and night-duty is a service which must be spared wherever it
can be spared, and rendered as efficient as possible wherever it
is really wanted.</p>

<p>I have before submitted that in Paris, Vienna and Berlin, the
average of severe cases in Army Hospitals, in time of peace,
is very considerably lower than in Civil Hospitals.</p>

<p>This quite as much applies to English Army Hospitals.
Whether the ordinary wards would require night-duty I do not
know. If they often did, I should prefer having a regular
night-duty in them. If they seldom required it, I would not
have it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>21. In Civil Hospitals, served by women, I should undoubtedly
prefer assigning the night-duty to one Assistant Nurse.</p>

<p>22. But Orderlies are in sundry respects different, and,
upon the whole, I recommend not to have night Orderlies,
but to let each Orderly in turn do the night-duty.</p>

<p>23. It is important to remember&mdash;the more so as it is often
forgotten&mdash;that to lay more upon human nature than its
Maker has made it to bear, is to do a foolish, let alone a
wicked thing. Upon an average, all men and women can dispense
with, or abridge sleep for more or less time. Upon an
average, all men and women, after a laborious day, require a
good night, in the long run. When they do not have it, either
health, efficiency, or sobriety, or all go.</p>

<p>Believe, again, that this is not theory, but the result of
practical observation, much extended.</p>

<p>A strong soldier is no exception to the general rule. In
the long run, if made to do night-duty after a laborious day,
he will either go to sleep, or drink to keep awake, or he will
get knocked up before his time. And this it is part of his
business to be in time of war; therefore, in peace-service, it
is economical to let him last his time. It is then sound
economy to give watchers sufficient sleep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scheme of
Night-Service
for Three
Orderlies
watching by
turns.</div>

<p>24. Supposing regular night duty required, in a ward of 30
men, supplied as above, and served by half a Nurse and three
Orderlies, it might be worked thus: the Principal Medical
Officer would decide whether the same Orderly should do the
night duty for a week, or the three on successive nights: probably
the latter. The Orderly might come on night duty at 9
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and remain on duty until 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, thus taking his share in
the heavy morning work of cleaning the ward, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> In all well-ordered
Hospitals it is required that this should be done by 10
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, in some by 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> Earlier is undesirable in the English
latitude (in other climates it is different), unless either the
patients are to be disturbed earlier than English Surgeons
consider right; or the ward, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> cleaning is hurried through.
A large ward, got into thorough order by 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, is in very
good time. Of course it may happen occasionally to be got
ready somewhat earlier, but this refers to the average.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Scheme for Three Orderlies A. B. C. Serving Ward X.</span></p>

<p>Monday, 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> A goes to bed, after taking his share of
the morning work, eating his dinner, and helping to clear away
ward dinner, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> A comes on night duty, after 5 hours’
sleep, and allowing 1 hour for undressing, dressing, and eating
his supper.</p>

<p>Tuesday, 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> A goes off duty, having watched until 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
having breakfasted, having taken his share of the morning
work, and leaving the ward clean. Let him have the option of
one or two hours’ fresh air, either now, or before 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>; let
him sleep full three hours; let him have his hot portion of
dinner taken to him at the usual hour, unless all the Orderlies
on night duty are served together at a different hour; and let
him, 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, return on duty, washed and shaved. B goes to
bed, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> B comes on night duty.</p>

<p>Wednesday, 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> B goes off duty; 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, C goes to
bed, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, C comes on night duty, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>I have reckoned 12 hours for the Orderly to be off duty. It is
better for him to have eight than seven hours’ sleep, and one or
two hours’ fresh air are more healthy, and make a man last longer
than going to and from his bed and his ward. An English
soldier comes on duty clean, washed, and shaved, a once national
peculiarity it is highly desirable he at all events should retain&mdash;at
any rate that of thorough cleanliness&mdash;the shaving is unfortunately
now not certain; for this and for his meals, some
little time must be given. I think you will get more, and get
it longer, out of the man by giving him 12 hours on night duty
and 12 hours off. Still it will not do to interfere too much with
analogies, and the proper authorities must decide whether this
is too much.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exercise for
Orderlies.</div>

<p>25. Again, leaving the question for decision to the proper
authorities, I had rather each Orderly had one hour or two hours
for exercise each afternoon or each alternate afternoon, care of
course being taken that he did not exercise himself in some tap.
He should report himself to the Nurse, or to the Ward-Master,
or Assistant Ward-Master on going and on his return. So
should the Night-Orderly when coming on and going off duty.
Also in many emergencies of no very unfrequent occurrence at
home, and constantly abroad, the Orderly must dispense with
recreation time. But as a rule, it is certain that fresh air is
necessary to preserve health in Hospital duty. Doctors of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>ll
kinds know and act on this as regards themselves.</p>

<p>The waste of time and strength, at present too often incurred
by the endless fetching, heavy carrying, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, of many Hospitals
is in a considerable degree counteracted by its forcing the
Nurses into other than ward air; the air of a Hospital Court
is better than that of the best ventilated wards as it is, not as
it might be. The same applies, in its degree, to Orderlies.
But it is better, and far more economical, to avoid the fetching
and carrying as much as possible; to keep the ward attendants
in the ward to their duty under the supervision of the chief
and responsible ward-servant; and to give each in turn a short
daily recreation, if possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Night
Refreshment
for Orderlies
necessary.</div>

<p>26. Now comes a thing I am very anxious about concerning
night duty, the more anxious because it is important, and
because I am afraid it is an innovation. I have watched the
night duty with particularly anxious interest, in each Hospital
I have entered, feeling at once its importance and its difficulties,
and of the following principle I am thoroughly certain.</p>

<p>The Orderly doing night duty should either be allowed
refreshment during the night, or the recurrence of this night
refreshment should be considered in allotting the rations.</p>

<p>In none of the Civil Hospitals, so far as I know, is night
refreshment given. The Nurses usually on board wages,
apportion, when they can, some from their food. In one
Hospital there exists a rule that no Night Nurse is to take
refreshment during her watch, the intention being to keep her
more vigilantly to her duty. This is one instance among many
of the serious and cruel mistakes which men of business or benevolence,
or both, make, when legislating on matters which they
do not understand. It is, fortunately for the fine Hospital
where it is the rule, practically disregarded; the Head Nurses
knowing well that a Nurse watching and fasting in a ward from
9 to 9, or even from 9 till the breakfast hour of 6, would either
soon be unfit for duty, or put drams in her pocket, or doze
through the night.</p>

<p>A strong soldier, required to watch in a ward and fast from
9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> till 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, or 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, or shortly before, would stand
the trial quite as ill as a Nurse. There is an admirable rule at
two foreign Hospitals where I have served. Sisters watch in
some wards, Men Nurses in others; and each watcher receives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
from the house, on going on night duty, a bottle of beer, a can
with about six or eight cups of coffee, milk and sugar in proportion,
and three slices of bread and butter. The Sister’s bottle of
beer is about one pint; the Man-Nurse’s double; his coffee
can is also a good deal larger. The rule of allowing sufficient
for three solid refreshments (which of course can if desired be
made by the watcher two or three) during the night, is an
excellent one.</p>

<p>I think it would be very sound economy to allow each Orderly
on night duty, a proportion of beer or porter, of coffee or tea,
and of bread and butter, or bread and cheese, to take at his
own time during his watch, besides his supper before going on
duty, and his breakfast just before 6, (both Nurse and Orderlies
ought to have breakfasted by 6, and to begin the day duty at 6,
and I wish it began by opening the windows and repeating the
short prayers for 5 or 6 reverent minutes). Of course it may
be considered preferable to reckon this night-ration in the
Orderly’s rations. Or suppose the bread and beer or porter
to be reckoned in the rations, and a can of coffee given him
for the night watch. Settle details as is best, and of course
analogies must be considered; but in truth hospital watching
is a very peculiar business; important, unobtrusive, most
peculiarly trying, and the bright side of very few Hospitals.
Each watcher should undoubtedly have refreshment for the night.</p>

<p>The Nurse should have her groceries in the lump, and refresh
herself as she likes out of them. Her watching, if she does her
duty, will be, when she has bad cases, severe enough; but
I would not provide her with extra refreshment; as the watching
is not prescribed and regular duty.</p>

<p>There should be as little extra watching on the part of
Orderlies as is possible; when it is indispensable the extra
watcher should have the same night-ration. I submit my
strong impressions on the subject of this night refreshment
now, because, small as it may seem, it very largely enters into
the working of a night watch.</p>

<p>I have suggested the division of the Night Orderly’s sleep,
because, if A. comes on duty at 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and is sent to bed at
noon or 1 to get ready for his night watch at 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, he is
scarcely fit for a long sleep, and supposing the patients dine at
noon (an excellent hour) he has not, or scarcely, taken his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
share of the clearing away which, got over in time, enables the
other Orderlies, one or both, to have a short recreation in the
afternoon. Also if sent to bed at one he has not eight hours’
sleep, as out of that he has to undress, dress, and sup. Also he
has to remain on duty from 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> to 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> next night, which is
much too long as a rule. If he does not go to bed before his
watch, and goes off duty at 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> next morning, whatever time
may be then allowed him for sleep, he cannot, as a rule, be
depended upon for performing his watch duty efficiently.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Where are the
Night
Orderlies to
Sleep by Day?</div>

<p>27. If the Ward Orderlies watch by turns, it should be arranged
that the men who sleep before and after the watch can do so
quietly. This is by no means always attended to, as to Nurses
in Civil Hospitals. Upon the whole, I cannot think it would
answer to have always the same watchers, as regards Orderlies.
The other Orderlies, supposing them lodged apart from the
wards, will certainly go seldom enough to their quarters during
day, except during their exercise time. It may be thought
essential to retain soldiers under very primitive notions as to
quarters. So though in a dormitory of women, I think little
cells, parted either with a partition or a curtain, the whole
thoroughly airy, are in all respects preferable to unparted
rooms, it may be, by some, thought better that the Orderlies
shall sleep in large airy wards, not parted by curtains or partitions.
I know, however, one high Military authority, at least;
who considers the same reasons apply to men as to women in
this. Soldiers are generally able to go to sleep whenever
ordered. Indeed their general capacity of doing whatever they
are bid is one of their many fine points. The Orderlies’ wards
must be under some sort of inspection, and noise must not
be suffered in them. Non-Commissioned Officers, either Ward
or Assistant Ward-Masters, or some special functionary (but
such I would not multiply) must sleep near, and have general
charge of the order and quiet of such wards. I conclude that
one or more Assistant Ward-Masters, at all events, must watch,
and as they must sleep by day, this will fit in well enough.</p>

<p>I should avoid putting the Orderlies in a too much out of the
way part of the Hospital; they should know themselves liable
to inspecting visits any time. I am not sure that Ward or
Assistant Ward-Masters would not be much better guardians of
the Orderlies’ wards than any special functionary. Drink <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>is the
vice of these men, noble fellows as, as a body, they are, and I
should avoid quartering any man too comfortably and solely in
one particular post. Cases have been where the duenna of the
Nurses’ dormitory was herself a determined, disguised drunkard,
and reported others accordingly as she was bribed or not
with drink for herself.</p>

<p>The whole question of Orderlies sleeping near or away from
their wards should be well considered by the proper authority,
two or three experienced Army-Surgeons. Upon the whole, I
think it would be well to try the quartering them separately:
there is much to be said on both sides as usual.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comparative
Merits of
Different
Systems of
Night
Nursing.</div>

<p>28. In several foreign Hospitals a certain number of Night
Watchers, both Sisters, and Men-Nurses, are told off for night-duty
for four weeks, during which they are exempted from all
labour by day, and receive better food than the usual diet.
They also receive good night-refreshment.</p>

<p>In one Hospital the following is the arrangement. The
wards usually contain from 10 to 13 beds, and there are many
small wards for three, two, or one, bad cases or operation cases.
All the wards open upon a corridor. The Sisters do not watch
in the men’s wards.</p>

</table>

<p>An operation-case, or an extra bad or anxious case, or a case
requiring special attendance and put in a single ward, has an
Extra-Watcher. Often there are no Extra-Watchers: sometimes
there are several at once. The Extra-Watcher is either a
Sister or a Man-Nurse, taken from among the other Sisters or
Men-Nurses, who, after his or her day’s duty, does the extra
watch.</p>

<p>As regards all English hospitals, civil or military, the
advantages of this system are these:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. It severs certain persons for night-duty, who have full
time for sleep and refreshment in the air during day, and who
are allowed to do no other work.</p>

<p>2. It secures these persons good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> food and refreshment at
night.</p>

<p>3. These persons know their sick, and, being told on coming
on duty, of any change, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, are as much at home in their posts
by night as others are by day.</p>

<p>4. When it is found that a Sister cannot sleep by day, and,
therefore, that her health breaks, she is not allowed to finish
the four weeks and become ill, but is put to another duty and
another Sister appointed to the watch.</p>

<p>(Many a strong Nurse cannot sleep at day.)</p>

<p>5. The persons so appointed get into the way of it, if they
stand it at all, and the system is found a great relief to the
whole house and a great gain to the sick, in the place of
another system of dividing the night between two Sisters and
two Men-Nurses, who each watch half of the watch.</p>

<p><i>Per contrà.</i></p>

<p>I. The great London hospitals are places very far from
perfect: some things may, please God, be, with time, patience,
and extreme quietness, very much improved; but some things
will never be perfect and never can be. But they are places
where I do believe, and so far as I know, the sick are cared for
in a way that is done nowhere else. The proportion of heavy
cases in every London ward, cannot, I think, be met except by
having a watcher in each. An English physician or surgeon
would not consider that his cases could otherwise receive the
attendance and the watching, the observation of possible change
and prevention of possible mischief, which they ought to receive.</p>

<p>It is right to bear in mind,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That small wards multiply exceedingly the demand for
Watchers: four wards, of 10 patients each, taking the average of
patients as in London, would not be attended, according to the
English notion, by one Watcher; 40 patients in one ward
would be fully attended by one Watcher. The London
Hospital has two Night-Nurses for its quadruple wards.
An extra Night-Nurse has frequently to be put on, on account
of the difficulty the subdivision of the ward gives to the
watching.</p>

<p>2. That the average of severe cases in each ward of
London hospitals is very considerably more than the proportionate
average of severe cases in each ward of the foreign hospitals
in question. In all foreign hospitals with which I am
acquainted the proportion of accidents is comparatively small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>to those of the London hospitals. The docks, the manufactures,
the crowded and dangerous works, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, with us,
account for this.</p>

<p>3. That, striking the balance for and against, it is necessary
that each London ward should be watched by a Nurse;
at the same time, that without doubt a certain number of
troublesome, ill-conditioned patients (no ward of any Hospital
is without such) sleep soundly and let their neighbours sleep
soundly when the Watcher only looks into the ward at frequent
intervals, who would, if the Watcher sate in the ward the whole
night, make it their business to require attendance from the
Watcher during the whole night, or at least much oftener than
by the other plan.</p>

<p>II. The second flaw of the above system, as it applies to
London Hospitals, is, that it renders Extra-Watchers so often
indispensable.</p>

<p>The employment of Extra Watchers can never be wholly
prevented, but it should be the endeavour of every Hospital
to employ such as seldom as can possibly be. Extra watching
is most injurious to the health of all ward-servants, and to the
sobriety, and therefore morality, of many paid ward servants.</p>

<p>This is a very important reason, I humbly consider, for
avoiding as much as possible small wards.</p>

<p>I do consider small wards very objectionable in working a
Hospital.</p>

<p>But it is right to remember that we have been told of England,
of Austria and of Prussia that the proportion of severe cases in
Military Hospitals in time of peace is considerably smaller
than in Civil Hospitals. Night watching is not done in the
Military Hospitals either of Vienna or Berlin. Orderlies, or
an Orderly, sleep in each ward, and watching is only done to
bad cases.</p>

<p>How far English Army Surgeons consider night watching
desirable in the Army Hospitals I will presently tell.</p>

<p>I should think the convalescent wards, among many important
advantages, would receive a number of patients who require
no night watching. An Orderly ought to be at hand here, but
not watching.</p>

<p>If night duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> is considered requisite in the ordinary wards,
I do not see how the English standard of things could be met,
excepting by having one Watcher in each ward where there is
regular night watching.</p>

<p>I think, however, that the foreign system of night watching
above detailed might give very useful hints for women in war
service, and for emergencies of cholera, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, in home
service; and with regard to supervision in the latter.</p>

<p>I think, with submission to the proper authorities (the two
or three experienced Army Surgeons I have so often adverted
to) feeling strongly that awkward mistakes might occur in
several of these matters without them, as civilians and women
cannot and ought not to trust their own judgments respecting
such, that in a large Military Hospital, an Assistant Ward-Master
ought to go round the wards at night. Not with any
idea of his rendering assistance to the Watchers over bad cases.
The Nurses must do their duty of Head-Nurses, and see to this
themselves. Perambulation through a large Hospital at night
in point of fact excludes the possibility of doing anything in
any one ward, unless in some exceptional occurrence which
only proves the rule. The object is the important one of seeing
that the Orderlies are awake, sober, alert, and at their duty,
and that the patients are quiet and in bed. The Nurse would
hear any noise, but there is such a thing as quiet drinking, as
well as noisy drinking.</p>

<p>In <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s there is a Night-Matron, chief over the
Night-Nurses, who goes through the Hospital every hour
during the night-watch.</p>

<p>I have heard this spoken of by experienced Authorities of
other Hospitals with approbation and envy, and some idea was
entertained of introducing it into another great Hospital.
In Civil Hospitals, I think, but I do not know, that the benefits
of this Night-Matron may be perhaps more imaginary than
real. The Head-Nurses at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s sleep away from their
wards; a great mistake, I humbly consider.</p>

<p>But Military Hospitals are entirely different in sundry essential
respects. I think a non-commissioned officer, Assistant
Ward-Master for instance, ought to make his rounds every
night. When once such a service takes place, every hour is
better than three or four times a night. He must be “up to”
sundry things&mdash;taking the wards in uncertain rotation, sometimes
returning suddenly on his steps, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be worth securing, if possible (this parenthesis will
be understood), that the Nurse’s water-closet should be within
her room, if not, as close to it as may be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Present State
of Night-Nursing
in
Military
Hospitals.</div>

<p>29. The following extraordinary system of Night Nursing is
that which prevails in the Army at present:</p>

<p>The “nursing is managed” either by means of patients “told
off in watches” through the night for the purpose of attending
to other patients, or by means of soldiers sent in from the
ranks to attend specially upon each bad case; or by Orderlies
“arranging it among themselves,” without any exemption
meanwhile from day duty.</p>

<p>Upon each and all of these systems or no-systems it is hardly
necessary to make any comment. It is difficult to tell which is
the worst.</p>

<p>In the principal, indeed the only General Hospital in England,
“Nursing is managed by comrade-patients told off in
three watches of two hours each for the night.” [<i>sic.</i>]</p>

<p>“Orderlies are likewise warned and often sit up for the purpose.”</p>

<p>These passages are given <i>verbatim et literatim</i>, because they
are so remarkable.</p>

<p>And it is necessary to add that these patients being the
relapses among the “Invalids” are nearly the worst cases we
have.</p>

<p>Were it the report of a Head-Nurse in a Civil Hospital to
her Resident Medical Officer, it would undoubtedly cost her
her place. One scarcely knows whether to pity more the
sick patient or the orderly patient. One scarcely knows how
to estimate the amount of medical comforts intended to be
consumed by the sick patient which will actually be consumed
by the sitting-up patient, and necessarily so. And the expedient
which turns over the man who is too ill to be left at all to
the care of men who ought to be recovering themselves, but
who are pulled out of their beds for two hours to <em>nurse</em> (for
the first time perhaps in their lives,) and a very “serious” case
too, is to say the least of it a singular one.</p>

<p>At Woolwich Artillery Hospital the cases which require
constant attention are about 2 per cent. There are now 545
patients in Hospital, and 11 cases consequently, each requiring
one Orderly to itself. The Orderlies, according to Regulation,
are 55, so that one-fifth part of the Orderly service is requir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>ed
for these cases. Yet there is no system or arrangement for
such. The Orderlies arrange (or do not arrange) among themselves
to do the reliefs day and night. Of the 11 cases at this
time in Woolwich Hospital with 11 Orderlies sitting up with
them, it so happens, as I am informed, that only one would
require, if such were together in wards where regular night
nursing was established, an attendant specially to itself.</p>

<p>It is needless to enlarge upon the cruelty of the above practice.
The one serious case is disturbed in the day by the goings
to and fro, the noise and bustle of the light cases&mdash;while these
are disturbed at night by the sitting-up necessary for the one
bad case, which may be besides, and too often is, a noisy or
offensive one. The bad economy is as obvious. It often happens
that 11 cases who might all, if in one ward, be attended
and as efficiently attended, by one Night Orderly, require each
an Orderly to itself in as many different wards.</p>

<p>In the “Garrison Hospital” at Chatham, “when any case
assumes such a character as to require more than the usual care
and watching, a Requisition is immediately sent to the Commanding
Officer of the Corps to which the man belongs for a
steady well-conducted soldier and who generally is the man’s
own comrade” [so much the worse] “to nurse him, and to attend
upon him throughout his illness, but who is relieved by
another as often as the Medical Officer in charge of the case
considers necessary.”</p>

<p>The following is the average number of sick in Army General
Hospitals in time of peace at home, for whom night-nursing
is considered necessary by the Medical Officers. But it is important
to add that this number would be probably estimated
as very much higher if proper means of night-nursing were
at their disposal.</p>

<p class="hang">Of constantly sick mean proportion per cent. requiring night
nursing:</p>

    <td class="tdr">2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>These cases are usually scattered through the wards.</p>

<p>It is but fair to add that the best Medical Officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> themselves
desire another system, or rather are aware that there is at present
no system at all, and would gladly accept one. “With
means for good night-nursing,” they say, “arrangements in
accordance might be introduced. At present we like to have a
case requiring much attendance amongst cases that require
little, in order that the patients or comrades may assist.”</p>

<p>What are the consequences of such “assistance” to the
cases in question has already been fully stated throughout these
notes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poor-Law
Regulation for
Nursing in
Union Workhouses.</div>

<p>“With respect to the use of [the inmates as] servants, they
require the strictest superintendence on the part of the * *
officers. The employment of [the inmates] in offices of trust
is inexpedient, inasmuch as it tends to impair the discipline of
the house. In offices of mere labour, which can be performed
under trustworthy superintendence, [the inmates] may be
useful. Where responsibility is involved, paid servants should
be engaged.”</p>

<p>The above is one of the regulations of what?&mdash;not of a
Charitable Institution but of the Poor Law; and the house of
which it treats so tenderly and wisely is&mdash;a Workhouse!<a name="Anchor_19" id="Anchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a> If
paupers are to be thus cared for, how should it be with our
soldiers? If any “office” can be called one “of trust,” surely
it is that of carrying out the orders of the Medical man in a
critical case, a case of life or death! Can any “responsibility”
be “involved,” greater than this? Yet these are just the
cases left to the “Comrade Patients.” For ordinary cases the
ordinary attendance is given; for serious cases, the untrained
and unskilled attendance. Yet, if the Hospitals are not for
these serious cases, what are they for? For these alone, however,
is no systematic provision made. One would think that
every bad case took the Hospital by surprise. Imagine the
orders of the Medical Officers carried out by nurses (?)
changed “every two hours,” and who are, in fact, sleepy
patients!</p>

<p>The system of Military nursing and management, as described
by Army Medical Officers themselves in the above quotations,
and which is, we are expressly told, to be re-enacted at the Royal
Victoria Netley Hospital, is precisely the one which led, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> a
matter of course, to the calamities, as far as nursing was concerned,
in the Hospitals in the East, and which will lead to them
again so long as it is continued. Even in the case of invalids, who
may not require such careful attendance as sick, the system of
nursing by comrades is most objectionable; and if the attendance
at Netley can only be carried out on such a plan, it is
doubtful whether Netley should be used even for an Invalid
Hospital.</p>

<p>The question has been asked the Netley Committee, By
whom are your Invalids to be nursed, when sick? And it has
been answered, that they are to <em>nurse each other</em>!</p>

<h3 title="">II. <span class="smcap">Nurse’s Room</span>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Nurse’s Room.</div>

<p>It is essential that between every two wards, in a hospital
where the blocks are built end to end, there should be, as at
the new Military Hospital of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vincennes</span>, a lobby with a
thorough supply of pure fresh air.</p>

<p>If it were possible, where the Head Nurse, or rather in a
Military Hospital the Nurse, has charge of two such wards on
the same floor, to let her have a long, narrow room, with
screened windows, opening into both wards, the door opening
into the passage in the midst, it is worth contriving.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Medical
Officer’s Room.</div>

<p>2. The Medical Officer’s room should be on the ground floor
at the entrance and apart from everything else.</p>

<p>The servant or whoever cleans the room, should not be a
Ward-Orderly, (ward-attendance cannot be kept too entirely
separate from all other concerns).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Water-Closets.</div>

<p>3. The ward water-closet should have a pane of glass at top,
so that a faint gas-light in the lavatory at night can light
sufficiently the closet, and the (bed-pan) sink.</p>

<p>The water-closet should be constructed, as is done often
in those of English railway stations, so that each visitor
involuntarily, on rising or on opening the door, purifies the
concern.</p>

<p>Besides the ward water-closet, there should be general
water-closets, and urinals separate from the wards, for the use,
during the day, of those patients who can leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
wards.</p>

<p>The latrines at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lariboisière</span> Hospital are a good example,
both for what should be avoided in construction, and what
should be imitated in position.</p>

<p>The sort of latrine used there would never do for England.</p>

<p>The men able to go out are expected to use by day an urinal
in a corner of the little garden belonging to each pavilion.</p>

<p>At night no sick men are allowed to leave the ward on that
or any other pretence; they must use the latrines.</p>

<p>The latrines are at the furthest end of the ward. Opposite
the one door is a partially glazed door, beyond this is a large
window, grated in network as well as with panes and frame.
On one side opens a space where the men, able to get up, are
expected to wash, and which, moreover, contains two latrines,
each separated by a partition and secured by a door. The
same arrangement prevails on the female side.</p>

<p>The rule of having the water-closet on the furthest side of
the ward, removing all pretence of leaving the ward by night,
is excellent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Warm and
Cold-Water
Supply.</div>

<p>4. The importance, immense addition of efficiency, and
ultimate economy of carrying warm and cold water into every
ward, and the necessity of intending and contriving this in the
first construction of a Hospital,&mdash;subsequent additions and
alterations being generally less effectual, and always more
expensive&mdash;cannot too frequently be repeated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Corridors.</div>

<p>5. Corridors as proposed at Netley are useful and objectionable.
They lie between one side of the wards and air. They
make oversight of the patients more difficult; and when a
number of patients are walking up and down them, the serious
cases in the wards are disturbed. On the other hand, it is
desirable to have some place of exercise and yet shelter for
patients, capable of being heated and of being overlooked.
There ought to be no accumulation of patients at the same time
suffered.</p>

<p>With regard, however, to corridors inside the building, if
there are none it is all the better for the sick; that each ward
should have two rows of large windows opening direct into the
outer air is indispensable, as has often been said already.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lobby.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></div>

<p>6. Provided this double range of windows be secured, double
wards of thirty on the same floor would cause no disadvantage
to the sick.</p>

<p>But, if such be determined on, let especial care be taken to
separate the two, not by a showy hall, but by a lobby and an
ample staircase, extending from top to bottom of the building,
and communicating freely with the open air at the roof, as well
as by the stair-windows: admitting a thorough current of
external air, so that, of a morning especially, the two wards do
not mutually send the close air into each other.</p>

<p>The lobby should not be turned into a vestibule.
Thorough air is all that is wanted. Patients should not be
suffered to remain in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Material of
Ward
Utensils.</div>

<p>7. The material of the different utensils required for ward
service should be settled. In the use of glass or earthenware
for all eating, drinking, and washing vessels there is great superiority
as to cleanliness, and the saving of time and labour
in cleaning these materials, to those of tin or other metal.
Still two things have to be weighed against these great advantages.
First, if these vessels are cleaned by Ward-Orderlies,
the amount of breakage would be much greater in proportion
than as done by Nurses, and it is imperative to have as few
women as possible in the service of Military Hospitals.
Secondly, it is very important to avoid even the appearance,
especially at first, of anything like introducing luxury into
Army Hospitals; and I can quite understand this appearing
like luxury.</p>

<p>The material of one description of ward-vessels should in particular
be left to the Surgeons. In sending to distant foreign
or war-stations, urinals of tin have one material advantage over
those of glass or china, that they do not break so easily; but,
as to home-service, these tin urinals cannot, by any amount of
cleaning, be freed from an unclean smell. In Vienna General
Hospital, where economy is exceedingly attended to, all the
urinals are of glass, as the superior cleanliness is considered
well worth the additional expense. A damaged or broken glass
or earthenware urinal is dangerous; and if there is difficulty in
obtaining the immediate issue of a new for a damaged one, it is
better to have tin.</p>

<p>In Vienna General Hospitals the patients’ eating vessels
were formerly of tin; but were some time ago furnished of
earthenware, for the same reasons as those given above; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>also
because the hot tin vessels were found awkward to the patients.
(I do not think much of this latter reason; in hospitals, there
is little fear of food reaching the patients too hot). In Vienna
and Berlin Military Hospitals the eating vessels are all of tin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reserve Wards.</div>

<p>8. In building a large new Hospital, the question of whether
or not reserve wards, or Pavilions, should be provided is an
important question, to be referred to the proper Authorities.
In one German Hospital is a Sommer-Lazareth, or separate
Hospital, which most of the sick occupy during the six summer
months. This is considered the best plan; but so expensive
that well-considered arrangements in designing the building
may render its adoption unnecessary. In another German
Hospital is a group of wards on each of two floors, into which
the male and female patients, especially the surgical cases, are
successively moved; both in order that during this time the
other wards may be thoroughly cleaned; also to change the air;
also in case of some sudden epidemic, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>In every Hospital a thorough cleaning of the wards is essential.
In three of the great London Hospitals this is done every
year, in one every three years. Nuisance as it is, for the time
being, it is such a complete purification of places which want
purifying, that having it done every year is preferable to every
three years. For the same reasons bare white walls, whitewashed
every year, and oftener if there has been some sudden
outburst of any zymotic disease or Hospital gangrene are preferable
to all colour. But polished impervious cement is, it is
needless to repeat, the only really safe Hospital wall. When the
cleaning time of a great London Hospital draws near, the number
of patients is gradually reduced, and none but urgent cases
taken in. The cleaning usually begins with the topmost ward
of one part of the building, or of several parts of the building
at once. The patients are usually moved to the ward immediately
beneath. The ward goes through a complete purification,
also reparation of whatever wants repair. All its furniture
ditto; the bedsteads in particular. Afterwards windows and
doors are left wide open for two or three days, and nights so
far as feasible. In about a week from its commencement the
cleaning is over; the patients moved back; and the ward or
wards so cleaned recommence their usual taking-in&mdash;and so <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>on.
The cleaning of a great London Hospital usually takes two
full months; and a great nuisance it is for the time, but the
place benefits by it the whole remaining ten. It is excellent
economy to have plenty of hands, so as to have the cleaning
part, in distinction to the airing part, done as quickly as
thorough cleaning admits of. It is very bad economy to put
too much of this great extra cleaning upon the Nurses. This
would of course not apply to a Military Hospital, where it is
important the Orderlies should become as thoroughly qualified
as may be for foreign and war service. It is necessary that
whatever exterior help is called in, should be closely overlooked;
contractors and contractors’ servants being seldom overmuch
troubled with conscience.</p>

<p>Now it might be exceedingly worth while to have one or more
reserve Pavilions, with a view to this annual cleaning.</p>

<p>If the flooring of polished oiled boards should be found to
answer (that it should receive a fair trial is very desirable, as it
might result in a material benefit to our Hospitals), it would
be doubly useful, when, every third year or so, the oiling and
polishing required renewal, to leave the newly-oiled wards empty
for a fortnight. An additional week or two would additionally
harden and improve the flooring; but a fortnight would suffice.</p>

<p>It might also be right to have reserve wards for what must
occur every now and then in a Military Hospital, an influx of
patients beyond the usual number, or an outbreak of cholera,
or some malignant epidemic, which it might be desirable to
isolate from the other patients.</p>

<p>It may now be confidently expected that, under the new
<i>régime</i>, the progress in improvement of Military Hospitals
will proceed rapidly; that it will be quietly done is almost as
certain&mdash;real improvement and noisy philanthropy being fearfully
inconsistent with each other, especially in that momentous
machine called the Army of England, which is no safe
plaything.</p>

<p>Dr. Helm, the Director of the Vienna General Hospital, in a
little pamphlet published some time ago, insists on the importance,
in designing a new Hospital, of providing Reserve wards,
especially with a view to dangerous epidemics. They should
admit, he urges, of easy and complete isolation from all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> the remaining
parts of the building.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Occasional
Revision of
Rules.</div>

<p>9. Dr. Esse, Director of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité</span>, at Berlin, in a practical
and systematic, but pedantic and pudding-headed, little book
on Hospitals, published in 1857, strongly urges the importance
of occasionally revising and altering the rules of Hospital
Officers and servants, and all the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité</span> instructions end with
this proviso of alteration. It is one of our many unavoidable
difficulties that it is necessary to begin our work under definite
rules, while it is also necessary to consider the service, for some
years to come, as tentative and experimental. It is well to
bear in mind what cannot be expressed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defect in some
Systems of
Nursing.</div>

<p>10. In admiring much, very much about the German Hospitals,
it becomes necessary not to omit a warning. A number
of women, all equal among themselves, with no female Superior
or Superiors whatever, under the sole control of men, in an
ascending scale from the Abtheilungs-Inspectoren or Oberkrankenpfleger,
through Doctors of sundry ranks, to the Director
himself, such is the system followed, as in the great <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité</span>
Hospital at Berlin, so in the great General Hospital at Vienna;
and this cardinal mistake leads to many others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nurses’
Exercise.</div>

<p>11. It is desirable that the Rules should give daily exercise
to the Nurses, or rather that the Rules should give them the
right of daily exercise; that the Superintendent should encourage
and exhort them to take fresh air daily when feasible, leaving
them sometimes to take a little quiet in their rooms. But in
war service, and sundry foreign stations in time of peace, not
merely exigencies of service (which at home will and ought often
enough to curtail or abrogate exercise time), but various other
reasons might render it very undesirable to give the Nurses
right to two hours’ daily exercise. It must be impressed upon
all Superintendents, that it is essential in the long run to the
health of Nurses to have fresh air; but in many foreign stations
it might be far better for the Superintendent to take, or
rather send, them out for one <i>vice</i> two hours, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>In war and foreign service, the exercise time must be at the
discretion of the Superintendent.</p>

<p>There may be awkwardness enough on sundry home stations
in allowing each Nurse two hours at her own discretion outside
of the Hospital every day. Still it is right to look things
in the face. The Rules do not contemplate a Sisterhood, but a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>staff of secular women, bound by strict rules in all that concerns
the duty they undertake, left to themselves as to sundry things
which in Sisterhoods are ruled. (How and by what measures
in process of time strong and quiet religious influence may be
brought to bear upon this staff, is the question of vital importance
as to the whole; without it, I doubt whether the service
of women would, in the long run, answer in Military Hospitals,
which are and must remain very peculiar places; with it, it
might please God to suffer good service to be done Him).
Nurses trusted to do their duty in wards must be trusted to
walk out alone if they choose, and I would not attempt to restrict
it, though the Superintendent must see to this, so far
as she can without doing or encouraging spy-work, a thing
which has many advantages, and is often done in various, very
various ways, but which in the long run brings no blessing, and
<i>pro tanto</i>, degrades all who are concerned with it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Number of
Ward-Masters.</div>

<p>12. In Vienna Military Hospital each set of five or six wards,
with 30 or 40 patients, sometimes 20, in each, had a Sergeant
and a Corporal over the Orderlies. (Berlin Military Hospital
is served by Civil male Nurses).</p>

<p>I think a Ward-Master would be enough for each Pavilion of
six wards of 30 patients each, in three stories, each couple of
wards being in charge of a Nurse, and each ward served by
three Orderlies.</p>

<h3 title="">III. <span class="smcap">Regulations.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Query as to
depriving
certain
Patients of
Visitors.</div>

<p>1. Proper military and medical advice should be taken as to
whether it would be advisable to draw a distinction between
the venereal and the other patients.</p>

<p>In the Vienna Military Hospital they are locked up by
themselves in particular wards, but are allowed to see their
comrades at visiting hours.</p>

<p>In the Berlin Military Hospital they are locked up in wards,
and allowed to receive no visits whatever, excepting, of course,
from the Chaplain and the proper Military and Medical
Officers; and in the case of dying patients from their nearest
friends.</p>

<p>Nor are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>they allowed exercise in the grounds.</p>

<p>This excellent regulation makes them heartily tired of the
venereal wards, and even this is a very salutary thing.</p>

<p>In the Vienna and Berlin Civil Hospitals, the venereal
patients of both sexes are also placed in locked wards, and
allowed no visitors. Nor are they allowed exercise in the
grounds or garden.</p>

<p>In the two Paris Venereal Hospitals no visitors are
allowed.</p>

<p>Now, as the more disagreeable the subject, the more
necessary it is to be explicit upon it when entered upon, this
wholesome discipline exists in a very faint degree in our great
Civil Hospitals,&mdash;a thing not to be lost sight of in introducing
any change in the Army Hospitals.</p>

<p>The three greatest London Hospitals have venereal wards.
The female patients never leave the ward. The male patients
take exercise in the court. In one case the rule is, that this
should be at different hours from the other patients; the rule
is not strictly adhered to.</p>

<p>The exercise question should, in Military Hospitals, be left
entirely to the Surgeons; they may fairly consider it enters
into the question of treatment, which is different from the
Continental treatment. The enforcement of different hours of
exercise from those of the other patients is good, as is every
brand which can, quietly and effectually, affix disgrace to these
wards.</p>

<p>Deprivation of visitors, if it could be done, would be very
salutary. In the great London Civil Hospitals, men and
women visit the male venereal wards; women alone the female
wards (and melancholy things are the visiting hours there;
here and there a heart-broken mother, abundance of prostitutes,
and no lack of procuresses. A firm and vigilant Head Nurse
will sometimes refuse admitting one of the two latter sorts to
some patient, whom she knows they are endeavouring to make
sure of again; but as the rules admit female visitors, and she
is by rights only entitled to eject a visitor whose behaviour is
disorderly in the ward, the Head Nurse can only do this in
point of fact by straining the rules, and cannot do it often).
The female visitors of the male venereal wards are usually, on
the average, much less disreputable than those to the equivalent
female wards; and are generally wives, mothers, and
sisters, seldom prostitutes. There can be no doubt, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
that it would be much better if the patients of neither male
nor female foul wards were allowed visitors, unless in the
comparatively very rare cases of extreme danger; it would, in
that case, be necessary that the Hospital should supply them
with linen, and either supply them with groceries or forbid
their receiving them from without.</p>

<p>In various essential respects the patients of a Military
Hospital are different from those of a Civil Hospital. Were
it possible to prevent all female visitors to the wards, except
in dangerous cases, this would be best. If the existing rules
or practice do not compel the sentries to refuse entrance to all
disorderly women, however orderly their behaviour, such a rule,
at any rate, should be enforced. And if all visitors, male and
female, including, of course, soldiers, could be refused
admittance to the venereal wards, always excepting cases of
great danger, it would be very desirable. At all events, it
would be very desirable to have all female visitors, without
exception, excluded from these wards. These things are, I do
consider, very important. But I would not press them, if
refused.</p>

<p>Let the female service obtain, please God (I do not write
these words <i>pro formâ</i>,&mdash;if possible, I feel every day more
intensely how solely it is to Him we must trust in this difficult
work,&mdash;the more so that, if possible, I feel every day more
intensely the importance of, if He grants it success, improving
secular Hospital nursing, leaving the English Sisterhoods, which
will always have great advantages, and, I believe, great disadvantages,
with reference to Hospital nursing, to take their share
in this great field, which has plenty of room for both), let, I
say, the female service obtain a firm footing in the Army Hospitals,
and with it, and by cautious degrees, sundry ameliorations
will creep in insensibly as to decorum among other
things. Those solemn beautiful words I have always felt so
full of meaning to us, “In quietness and in confidence shall be
your strength.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Query as to
Numbering
Patients.</div>

<p>2. Military as well as Medical advice should also be taken
upon the following point:</p>

<p>In most, not all, the great London Hospitals the patients,
whose names are on their bed-tickets, are called by the
numbers 1, 2, 3, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, suspended over each bed; sometimes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
patient’s name is never heard in the ward.</p>

<p>Now, very possibly, this would not at all do in a Military
Hospital, and, if so, there is not another word to be said
about it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, very few things so effectually save time, as the
numbering plan. (In Civil Hospitals it is also excellent in
other ways, of much less consequence in a Military Hospital,
which will never, I conclude, be afflicted with “gentlemen,”
Mr. So-and-So, and Master So-and-So, which latter inscription
is frequently to be read on the letters of little boys in Hospitals,
whose friends, on visiting days, also enquire for them by that
title). But few things, I repeat, so effectually save time as
numbering instead of naming the patients (names, of course,
to be on bed-tickets). If, however, the officers consider it
“unsoldierly,” give it up at once.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Regulations as
to Swearing.</div>

<p>3. The regulations lately in force contained in plain strong
language prohibition of swearing and indecent language in
Hospitals; they are quoted from the Articles of War. It
would be well to retain this in any new Regulations; and the
retention of this Rule is not the less important when women
are put in charge of Military wards, since, though it is not
their business to maintain discipline, it is their duty to call in
those whose duty it is when discipline is infringed. And it is
important that this prohibition of swearing and foul language
should not be looked upon as an individual or collective
crotchet, or female innovation, but remain the rule of the
Service. Such language would never be used in the Nurse’s
presence unless by her own fault. But it should be unheard
in the ward, whether she is in it or not. The old definite
words should be transcribed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conclusion.</div>

<p>I do not like writing any part of the above, not because it
can, in any sense, be said to strain the necessary principle of
reserve, save for strictly business purposes, as to all which is,
strictly speaking, Hospital business, but because of the extreme
caution necessary as to this sort of topics. Still life is so uncertain
that the possible introduction of permanent Female
Service into Army Hospitals has determined me on writing
what I had rather not have written.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Additional Hints as to Pavilion Hospitals suggested
by the construction of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lariboisière</span> Hospital
at Paris.</span></h2>

<h3 title="">I.&mdash;<em>Ventilation.</em></h3>

<p>The question of ventilation is so all-important, so much
doubt still seems to exist as to the comparative merits of
natural and artificial ventilation, so much has been said in
favour of the latter, because it is seen adopted in the finest
hospital in the world, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lariboisière</span>, that I have added a few
practical remarks upon this system. The conclusion is, that
even at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lariboisière</span>, without opening the windows occasionally,
and especially in the morning, real freshness is never
obtained in the wards, and that, therefore, if there must be
artificial ventilation, that is the best which allows the most of
the windows being opened.</p>

<p>On the men’s side, Thomas’ system, or that of injecting
air at given points, by means of two high-pressure steam
engines, each working a large fan, is adopted. On the
female side, Duvoir’s system affords ventilation by extracting
air at given points. In both, a number of shafts and openings
provide for the exit of the air.</p>

<p>Persons at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lariboisière</span> Hospital, who ought to be good
judges, including foremost the Director, an experienced and
able administrator, consider the ventilation on the male side
the most expensive and the best, both for day and night,
being the coolest in summer and the warmest in winter. In
winter two great advantages are assigned to this side: first, the
heating being provided by the Hospital, the wards are warmable
at pleasure; whereas that of the female side is provided
by the contractor at a fixed degree of heat, which, in extra
cold weather, is augmented: from 15° to 18° C are the usual
limits of the winter temperature on the female side, while that
on the male side is usually several degrees higher. Secondly,
the system of heating on the male side permits the windows
to be opened: while on the female side objections are often
made to opening the windows in winter, which it is alleged
interferes with the heating.</p>

<p><i>Per contrà.</i> How difficult it is to learn any facts by hearsay
we know. Other persons who ought to be good judges
think the male side apt to be too warm in winter, especially at
night, and consider the temperature on the female <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>side quite
sufficient.</p>

<p>Both sides are ventilated both by the windows and by the
machinery by day in summer. Both sides are ventilated, each
by its own different machinery, by night in summer, except
that, exceptionally on hot summer nights, a window is opened
two or three times in the night, or five minutes every hour.</p>

<p>Both sides are considered to be ventilated in winter mainly
by the machinery by day; and both sides are entirely ventilated
in winter by the machinery by night.</p>

<p>As far as can be made out from conflicting accounts, (conflicting
from the very simple reason that one person will consider
a ward, or drawing room, for that matter, airy which another
will consider close; one, pleasantly warm, another too hot or
too cold), it is practically found impossible to freshen the
ward of a morning without opening some windows, and to
keep it fresh during the day without now and then doing the
same; and it is easier to open the windows on the male side
in winter than on the female side.</p>

<p>The ventilation on both sides is considered to work with
equal efficiency during the whole of the day.</p>

<p>Of the eighteen wards, the ventilation on entering the wards
at five a.m., when the ward nightwatch has generally not
opened a single window, is certainly surprisingly good; <i>i.e.</i> the
air is surprisingly little bad. <em>But neither here, any more
than anywhere else, are the wards effectually freshened, until
the windows are, of course with proper caution, opened.</em></p>

<p>In both these particulars, no difference is to be observed
between the male and female side.</p>

<p>In repeating that the Director, and other persons who ought
to be good judges, consider the machinery of the male side the
most expensive and the best, I add these things:</p>

<p>First. Since this machinery was erected, so far as concerns
the steam engine, it is said that equally efficient and much
less expensive engines have been erected in other Hospitals,
among others, Necker and Beaujon. In both Hospitals, the
plans of Duvoir and Van Heecke are in use, one on either side.
But certainly, the system of outlets at Beaujon for the foul air
is by no means so good as at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lariboisière</span>.</p>

<p>Secondly. If an accident happened to the machi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>nery of the
male side, which is in communication with the steam engine,
the results might be very serious. Twice a stove has burst
on that side, happily without damaging anything else than
furniture near it; had patients been near it, they must have
been hurt or killed: and an accident on a large scale might
blow up not a small part of the Hospital.</p>

<p>More or less danger is inseparable from powerful steam
machinery, or powerful machinery of any kind: the question is
one of degree.</p>

<p>Thirdly. Both sides of the Hospital have one thing in
common. Except the sculleries of the 3 ground floor wards
on the male side, which have each a stove or fire place, the
kitchens or sculleries attached to all the other wards are warmed
by hot water. Undoubtedly this saves much mess, much
cleaning of stoves <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, and much bringing of fuel and consequent
dirt. But the absence of fire is always a loss to the
service of a ward. Sundry things, some one or other, often
all of which are constantly wanted in a large ward, <i>e.g.</i> warming
broth or drink, cooking for an extra bad case, warming
poultices, warming (not airing) linen for ditto, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,
are much more slowly done by water than fire heat, and it is a
question, variously answered, whether some of these things
are as well done by the slow water method, as by the quick
fire heat. Occasionally the hot water is not forthcoming, a
nuisance alike to the ward attendants of the ward whose
scullery is thus heated, and to those of the wards supplied
with stoves, which have then to do, in driblets, considerable extra
duty.</p>

<p>During the hot months the smell of the latrines is very
little perceptible in the wards, generally not at all: but the
test of this, as of the ventilation, is in winter, when the large
window close to the latrines is generally closed, and the smell
is very offensive.</p>

<h3 title="">II.&mdash;<em>Oiled Boards</em> versus <em>Parquets</em>.</h3>

<p>1. They have in common the superiority over common floorings&mdash;that
they are not scrubbed, and the damp thus arising is
avoided.</p>

<p>2. As re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>gards labour, so far as Civil Hospitals are concerned,
where the ward service is done by women, <i>parquets</i> would be
more laborious than scrubbing; a large ward, to be kept in a
proper state, requires a certain amount of <i>frottage</i> (the peculiar
polishing of <i>parquets</i>) every day; and this <i>frottage</i> is held to
be unfit, from the fatigue it causes and the strength it requires,
to be done by women, and is always done by men. Certainly
Ward Nurses could never be required to <i>frotter</i>; it is
altogether a man’s business.</p>

<p>3. As regards labour, so far as Military or Naval Hospitals
are concerned, where men preponderate in the ward service, it
is my impression (for of course I cannot pretend any certainty
as to this), that sailors who are proverbially handy (a different
quality from either laboriousness or endurance, though they
have these too) would, with instruction and painstaking,
accomplish in time <i>frottage</i>; that civilians would under the
same conditions; that soldier orderlies (infinitely, I humbly
think, the best material for the staple of military ward service),
would generally make bad <i>frotteurs</i>.</p>

<p>4. As regards labour, cleaning oiled boards, though a
laborious business, is much less so than either scrubbing or
<i>frottéing</i>; and is fully within the power of average strong
women: none other should nurse. (What subdivision of cleaning
the ward, and of nursing properly so-called, might both
improve the work done and relieve the Nurses, is another
thing; my impression remains, that it is better to consider
these things to a certain extent as distinct duties, discharged
by women ranking alike; and that in a ward of forty, served
by a Head Nurse and three Nurses, to charge one with the
main ward cleaning, is better economy of strength and time
than to divide it among the three).</p>

<p>5. As regards labour, any Orderly giving his mind to it for
a day at the shortest, or a week at the longest, ought to learn
thoroughly how to clean polished oiled boards well, always
supposing him to be properly taught a very simple thing, which,
like everything else, can be done well, ill, or indifferently.</p>

<p>6. Apart from the question of labour augmented or spared,
the advantages of oiled and polished boards I believe to be
these:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) Prevention of dust.</p>

<p>(2.) More easy purification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> of the air of the ward in the
morning.</p>

<p>The air of every ward becomes more or less impure during
the night, and the floor and furniture more or less dusty.
Making the beds in the morning adds to the dust the night
has accumulated.</p>

<p>The dust is more thoroughly destroyed by the cleaning
necessary to oiled and polished boards <em>of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span> variety</em>,
than by any other cleaning I have seen. It is fairly destroyed;
whereas both <i>parquets</i> and boards generally retain a little.</p>

<p>Also, the water, with which the oiled boards after being
swept are cleaned, freshens the ward and purifies it of the closeness
remaining of the night air, in a very speedy and remarkable
manner, which is even more evident as well as more useful
in winter than in summer&mdash;as in winter it is not possible to
admit as much air from the windows as in summer, especially
when it is most wanted, in the cold, close, early mornings.</p>

<p>The advantages of oiled and polished boards as counteracting
the spread of miasma, which is strongly dwelt on at Berlin by
competent authorities, I have not alluded to, as probably
<i>parquets</i> are considered equal in these respects to them.</p>

<p>Stains, mess, and dirt falling on polished oiled boards are
much more easily cleaned than on parquets.</p>

<h4 title=""><span class="smcap">Note.</span><br />

    <i>Mode of Cleaning Ward and Room Floors at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bethanien</span>, Berlin.</i></h4>

<h5 title="">I. <span class="smcap">Daily.</span></h5>

<p>1. Take a common hair broom, a broom with a hard brush,
a cloth of coarse flax, and one or two pails of cold water.</p>

<p>2. Sweep the floor and skirtings with the hair broom.</p>

<p>3. Dip the cloth in a pail, wring it gently between the
hands, so as to have the whole equally wet, not running. Throw
it on the ground, reverse the hard broom, and placing the
reversed handle upon the cloth, clean the floor close to the
skirtings, not the skirtings themselves, and the corners. When
the cloth becomes dry, rinse it and re-wet it in the same pail.</p>

<p>4. Then wet the cloth somewhat more, wringing it as
before, throw it on the floor at the end furthest from the door,
and placing the brush of the hard broom upon it, brush, firmly
and quickly, each board in the direction that the boarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
runs, about as far as the arms can reach, standing, not kneeling.
A small ward can be at once brushed wet, a large one
must be divided into parts, and each part be successively
brushed wet and brushed dry. When the cloth becomes dry,
rinse it and re-wet it.</p>

<p>5. To brush dry, rinse and well wring the cloth, brush as
before. The firmer you can press, the better and quicker the
floor will be dried. When the cloth becomes wet, rinse it and
wring it as before.</p>

<p>6. Change the water when dirty. More or less water must
be used, according as the floor is trod by dirty boots and
shoes.</p>

<p>7. Aim at drying the floor by one dry brushing; if not, it
must be dry brushed a second time. Once should suffice.</p>

<p>8. Ten minutes, at the furthest, after the dry rubbing is
over, the floor ought to be thoroughly dry. When it is quite
dry, sweep quickly over it with the hair broom.</p>

<p>9. On putting by the cleaning materials, rinse well the
cloth in clean water.</p>

<h5 title="">II. <span class="smcap">Weekly.</span></h5>

<p>1. Brush the skirtings with a small hard brush, and wipe
them dry with a rag, as the cloth would be too large, and wet
the walls.</p>

<p>2. Use more water to clean the floor, which will probably
require two dry brushings.</p>

<p>3. Clean the brooms and pails.</p>

<h5 title="">III. <span class="smcap">Annually.</span></h5>

<p>1. Throw warm, not hot, water on the floor, and brush
firmly and quickly, wet and dry. A very little soda in each
pailful will be an improvement. More than very little will
injure the flooring.</p>

<p>[A new cloth, which it is economical to cut from a great
piece which makes into some or many dozens, should be steeped
for a night in a pail once filled with boiling water, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>d in the
morning rinsed and wrung several times in clean cold water,
then used at once. Two or three new cloths can be steeped in
the same pail.]</p>

<h3 title="">III.&mdash;<i>Cautions in Hospital-Building.&mdash;Often repeated, but
oftener neglected.</i></h3>

<p>1. Wherever practicable build the hospital on arches; but,
for the sake of discipline, they should be locked up.</p>

<p>2. If practicable, let the laundry, if served by women, be
removed from sight of the place where the patients take
exercise, and of the ward windows.</p>

<p>3. In a Civil Hospital it is objectionable to give the female
patients right to take exercise in corridors which the officers
and servants have constantly to traverse to go to and from the
wards. In a Military Hospital it is of little comparative disadvantage
that the patients should do this, although,</p>

<p>4. In building a hospital it might be well worth while to
contrive that the covered space, essential to give the patients
power of taking exercise, should be used solely for that purpose.</p>

<p>5. In Germany, the general opinion is in favour of small
wards, twenty beds are considered the desirable maximum;
twelve, <i>per se</i>, better than twenty.</p>

<p>Ditto in Belgium, under the same restriction, although, in
practice, there are wards containing larger numbers.</p>

<p>In the old Hospitals at Paris, the number of patients is too
large. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité</span> has long great wards of 100 and 120
patients. At <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis (which is mostly for cutaneous, not
venereal, diseases, where the patients usually are long under
treatment and able to go about, and where there is little
acute illness,) wards of eighty and seventy beds are the rule,
smaller wards the exception. This may be considered an exceptional
class of patients. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charité</span>, somewhat densely
pressed upon by neighbourhood, is also not considered a
favourably circumstanced Hospital as to air.</p>

<p>Putting aside for a moment the sanitary question, which
we have fully discussed elsewhere, and which appears to be
decided in favour of wards of from twenty to thirty patients,
we will look upon the question of administration. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
moment we consider that a great public Hospital has to provide
efficient attendance for all the sick it receives, that it
must be economical of attendance, both because the expense
of attendance, as well as the other requirements of the sick,
commands all practicable economy; and because efficient
attendance in sufficient numbers is difficult to obtain; it
becomes evident that it is far better for the sick to have larger
wards, efficiently served by as few attendants as is compatible
with efficiency.</p>

<p>This, which is the fair statement of the case, strikes those
who have watched the working of the system of small wards
in North Germany as more true than ever.</p>

<p>Such persons consider that the size and numbers of the
wards at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lariboisière</span> Hospital, viz., thirty-four beds, including
the two in the little ward, are good: that preserving
the existing considerable space between the beds, and supposing
the same ratio of conditions as to windows, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, and the small
ward for two at the end, wards of forty or fifty would be equally
healthy for the sick, but that the number fifty should not be
surpassed.</p>

<p>Assuming, however, that thirty patients in a ward, or thirty-two,
are the maximum number, sanitary and administrative
necessities being conciliated, let us see what we do in our
Military Hospitals at home.</p>

<p>In most of our Regimental Hospitals the number of wards
and of holes and corners, in comparison with the number of
sick, is quite extraordinary.</p>

<p>In a hospital for a battalion 500 or 600 strong, we shall find
eight or ten wards of small size, a small kitchen, everything,
in fact, on a small scale, just as if a large French Hospital had
suddenly collapsed.</p>

<p>How much more sensible would it not be to have one or, at
most, two large wards for thirty sick each, with a small casualty
ward and an itch ward!</p>

<p>How much less expensive such a structure would be in
erecting and administering, and how much more easy would be
the discipline and oversight, not to mention the greater facility
of ventilation!</p>

<p>6. There is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>hing at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lariboisière</span> Hospital answering to
casualty wards. Besides the eighteen wards of thirty-four
each, the Hospital contains two little (and inconveniently
placed), wards of ten beds each, which, when medical cases
overflow, are made medical wards; and which are closed when
the ordinary wards suffice. But of casualty wards, for
offensive, or noisy cases, there are none, and the double-bedded
little ward at the end of each large ward is intended to
answer this purpose; also, but subsidiary to this, to allow now
and then a patient of the better class to have the comparative
privacy.</p>

<p>This latter consideration does not apply to a Military
Hospital. As to allowing Non-Commissioned Officers for
instance to be in the little wards, discipline would, I think,
very soon suffer.</p>

<p>But <em>if</em> casualty wards are provided for extra offensive,
and noisy cases, it seems to me that any Hospital would be
much better without these small wards attached to each larger
one.</p>

<p><em>Apart from the purposes which the casualty wards answer</em>, they
are a nuisance. If convalescent patients are put into them,
they are comparatively removed from inspection, and often
play tricks there. Patients requiring much attention can
seldom be put there, however their condition otherwise fits
them for the little ward, because the ward attendants, and
especially the Sister (as in secularly served Hospitals the
Head Nurse), find it <em>impossible</em> to serve the inmates of the
little ward properly, if there are also many serious cases in the
large ward.</p>

<p>I submit therefore that the small ward is only an incubus,
if casualty wards are provided. One thing is certain: a
patient requiring much attendance, put into a little ward,
ought to have an extra attendant to himself, by day and by
night; otherwise, either he is more or less neglected, or he
unduly monopolises the service of the ward attendants.</p>

<p>It remains a question for far others than women to settle,
whether offensive and delirious cases are under more favourable
conditions of cure when scattered in little wards,
than when assembled in a large, or in several small wards. On
this subject, I can only add my confirmed belief that a large
airy ward, provided with a few small wards, and with complete
ward attendance, is a much better place for the care and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
attendance of such cases, than small wards attached to the
ordinary wards.</p>

<p>7. Avoid many holes and corners. I could <em>not</em> recommend
a dining room for patients attached to each ward, or floor, or
pavilion. If there is any dining room, let all the convalescent
patients of the wards not being convalescent wards, dine
together in a room apart from the wards, and let the rest
dine each at his bed side. If not, let each patient dine at his
bed side.</p>

<p>At the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lariboisière</span> Hospital, each ward has a vestiary, a
doubtful arrangement. The nature of a Military Hospital
renders it proper to have but one vestiary under charge of
some man.</p>

<p>8. If possible, let all foul linen be delivered daily, twice
perhaps better than once daily, into the laundry, so as to
remain the shortest possible time in the neighbourhood of the
ward; otherwise, do what you will, foul Hospital linen will
fairly, to say the ugly truth&mdash;stink, and its temporary receptacle
will stink also. I would not make this temporary
receptacle a room. A large chest in the scullery, a region
under constant purification by fire and air, would be, as
already hinted, p. 88, the least bad place for an accumulation
inevitable to all Hospitals, but which should accumulate for
as little time as possible.</p>

<p>9. Provide from the first room for storing and issuing dried
clean linen, as well as laundry room.</p>

<p>10. In badly-planned Hospitals artificial ventilation is an
excellent auxiliary for expelling the foul air, engendered in the
ward, especially at night; but windows only can be relied upon
for introducing good air. Let Hospitals, therefore, be so constructed
as to admit of opening one or more windows as much
as possible all the year round, with as little chance of draught
as may be to individual patients, which can be done by providing
double windows, opening above and below, or by some
similar expedient.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Note on Contagion and Infection.</span></h2>

<p>There are no words in regard to which there is more misconception,
or more nonsense talked and written, than the two
words “contagion” and “infection;” and as the word “infectious”
has been used in these Notes, it is necessary to say
what it does mean, and what it does not mean. The word
“contagion” appears to have been first used by certain
classical writers to signify the spread of scab among sheep;
and it would have been well for humanity if the word had been
restricted to this very primitive bucolic signification. It was
not till centuries after Virgil’s death that the common sense of
men had descended so low as to introduce it into the Medical
vocabulary. This took place at a period when, from the neglect
of sanitary arrangements, pestilence attacked whole masses of
people, and when no one appears to have considered that
nature had any laws for her guidance whatever. It was not
until human intelligence had descended to this depth that men
seem to have bethought themselves of Virgil’s term as affording
them an adequate explanation for pestilence, and sufficient
reason for not exerting themselves to prevent its recurrence.
So it has continued ever since. The little word used in all
innocence by the poet for poetic purposes has become the
ground-work of every manner of false observation, false reasoning,
neglect of sanitary laws, lazarettos, quarantine, and continually-threatened
interruption to the commercial intercourse
of mankind. No single word has ever done so much harm to
the human race, or given such a proof of what a mighty thing
a word is!</p>

<p>One would have thought that, after the sanitary experience
of the last fifteen years, the word “contagion” would have
disappeared from our language; but, even in the last document
issued by the expiring Board of Health, written by their
Medical Officer, Mr. Simon, and based on erroneous statistical
evidence (Papers relating to the Sanitary state of the People
of England, 1858), it is stated that “a further&mdash;practically
speaking, unavoidable&mdash;cause of premature death in every civilized
country is the risk of its <em>current contagions</em>.” [The italics
are not mine.] And this refers to small pox, hooping cough,
measels, and scarlatina, the mortality from which we are to
presume, is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>“unavoidable.”</p>

<p>If this be Board of Health doctrine, it is certainly not
sanitary doctrine. It would have astonished the Health of
Towns Commission, and the first Board of Health.</p>

<p>“Contagion,” as its etymology implies, means the communication
of disease from person to person by contact. It is
often confused with “infection;” but it has quite a different
meaning. Contagion presupposes the existence of certain
germs, like the sporules of fungi, which can be bottled up and
conveyed any distance, attached to clothing, merchandize,
especially to woollen stuffs, for which it is supposed to have a
particular affection, and to feathers, which of all articles it
especially loves, so much so that, according to Quarantine laws,
a live goose may be safely introduced from a plague country;
but, if it happens to be eaten on the voyage, its feathers cannot
be introduced without danger to the entire community. The
absurdities connected with the doctrine are numberless. Suffice
it to say that in the ordinary sense of the term there is no such
thing as “contagion.” There are two or three diseases in
which there is a specific virus which can be seen, tasted, smelt,
and analysed, and which, in certain constitutions, propagates
the original disease by inoculation, such as small-pox, cow-pox,
and syphilis, but these are not “contagions” in the sense supposed.</p>

<p>With regard to the mysterious, imponderable, indivisible
nonentities, which make up our “current contagions,” they
may safely be dismissed into the limbo of extinct superstitions.</p>

<p>The word “contagion” therefore is altogether objectionable.</p>

<p>The word “infection” expresses a fact, without involving a
hypothesis.</p>

<p>It is most necessary, however, that the meaning should be
guarded; for, just as there is no such thing as “contagion,”
there is no such thing as <em>inevitable</em> “infection.” Infection acts
through the air. Poison the air breathed by individuals and
we have infection. Shut up 150 healthy people in a Black Hole
of Calcutta, and in twenty-four hours you have an infection
produced, so powerful that it will in that time have destroyed
nearly the whole of the inmates. Sick people are more susceptible
than healthy people; and if you shut up sick people
together, without a sufficient space and sufficient fresh air, you
will have not only fever, but erysipelas, pyæmia, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>nd the usual
tribe of Hospital-generated epidemic diseases produced.</p>

<p>Again, if we have a Fever Hospital with over-crowded badly-ventilated
wards, or with the air stagnant in them, we are quite
certain to have the air become so infected as to poison the
blood not only of the sick, so as to augment their mortality,
but also of the medical attendants and nurses, so that they
shall also become subjects of fever.</p>

<p>It will be seen at a glance that, in every such case and in
every such example, the infection is not inevitable, but the
simple result of gross carelessness and ignorance. In certain
Hospitals it has been the custom to set apart wards for what
are called “infectious” diseases; but, in reality, there ought
to be no diseases considered such. It follows from what has
been stated that, with proper sanitary precautions, diseases
reputed to be peculiarly “infectious” may be treated in wards
among other sick without any danger; just in the same way as,
with proper sanitary precautions, a number of healthy people
may be congregated together without becoming subject to the
horrors of the Black Hole of Calcutta.</p>

<p>It is in the highest degree probable that we should never
have heard of “infectious” wards, if the other wards of a
Hospital had been supplied with sufficient space and air for the
sick; and in too many cases it is to be feared that the presumed
“infectious” cases are huddled away into small, ill-lighted,
ill-ventilated rooms, a kind of Lazaretto, in fact,
where, if they die, they have at least been kept from doing
harm to the other sick in Hospital!</p>

<p>It is high time that common sense should deal with the
question; for there does not seem to be much hope for a deliverance
from these superstitions from any other quarter.</p>

<p>The “infectious” wards in Military Hospitals correspond,
in some sense, to the “casualty” wards in Civil Hospitals,
into which accidents, noisy, and erysipelatous cases are transferred,
when necessary. The advantages of a separate set of
wards for this class of cases have been already insisted upon in
these Notes; not certainly because the cases are inevitably
“infectious,” but because the segregation of such facilitates
greatly administration and nursing, while it removes offensive
and noisy patients out of the Hospital wards, whose inmates
they would annoy. The question of infection or non-infection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
has nothing to do with the arrangement. No stronger condemnation
of any Hospital or ward could be pronounced than
the simple fact that any disease has attacked other patients
than those first affected by it. “Infection” and incapable
management, or bad construction, are, in Hospitals, convertible
terms.</p>

<p>It may be useful to mention what the meaning is of the
words “epidemic,” “endemic,” “sporadic,” and “zymotic.”</p>

<p>When a large number of people are attacked simultaneously
with the same form of disease it is said to be <em>epidemic</em>. When
a small number, as, <i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, the inhabitants of a single court or
alley, are so attacked, it is said to be <em>endemic</em>. When scattered
cases of the same disease happen, one here, one there, over a
large surface, the disease is said to be <em>sporadic</em>. The term
<em>zymotic</em>, which includes all diseases of the preceding categories
and some others, implies the existence of certain changes in the
constitution or in the blood, rendering persons so affected liable
to the diseases in question.</p>

<p>It is a vulgar error to suppose that epidemics are occasioned
by the spread of disease, from person to person, by infection
or contagion; for it is an ascertained fact that, before
any people is attacked epidemically, the disease attacks
individuals in a milder form, one at a time, at distant
intervals, for weeks or months before the epidemic appears.
Before an epidemic of cholera, these cases consist generally
of diarrhœa of more or less intensity, followed by a
rapidly fatal case or two, very much resembling cholera.
Even plague itself, as in the recent epidemic at Bengazi, begins
with cases which cannot be distinguished from ordinary typhus-fever,
the succeeding cases getting more and more intense,
until the epidemic seizure takes place. Experience appears to
show that without this antecedent preparatory stage, affecting
more or less the entire population of a town or district, the
occurrence of an epidemic is impossible&mdash;the epidemic being, in
fact, the last or, so to speak, the retributive stage of a succession
of antecedent phenomena extending over months or years,
and all traceable to the culpable neglect of natural laws. It is
simply worse than folly, after the penalty has been incurred,
to cry out “contagion,” and call for the establishment of
sanitary cordons and quarantine, instead of relying on measur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>es
of hygiène. Epidemics are lessons to be profited by: they
teach, not that “current contagions” are “inevitable” but
that, unless nature’s laws be studied and obeyed, she will
infallibly step in and vindicate them, sooner or later.</p>

<p>In the words of the Registrar-General, which are as applicable
to Armies as to States, “Sanitary measures and not quarantines
are the real safe-guards of nations.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 title="Note on Observations by the Principal Medical Officer of the Army in the East"><span class="smcap">Note.</span></h2>

<p>I have just seen a paper by Sir John Hall, entitled
“<cite class="plain">Observations on the Difficulties experienced by the Medical
Department of the Army during the late War in Turkey</cite>.”
In this somewhat singular document, which appears to be a
defence of Sir John Hall’s own conduct, there are certain
statements made about the female nursing establishment in
the East which require a word of comment.</p>

<p>It will be observed that throughout the paper, the weapon
which Sir John Hall uses against all civil interference in repairing
the sufferings which proceeded from the defects of his
own department is simply detraction.</p>

<p>As for Civil Commissions, they were useless, as for Civil
Hospitals, they were costly, and their officers lived magnificently
and were extravagantly paid. As for the nurses, they
were benevolent, pious, well-intentioned persons, but what
could they do? How could one woman nurse eighty sick?
The medical men thought they could not.</p>

<p>Why had Miss Nightingale stores of port wine placed at her
disposal, which she could give to the French Hospitals, while
he, the principal Medical Officer of the Army, had no such
stores at his disposal?</p>

<p>Sir John Hall must have already discovered that this old
weapon is no longer of use in defending his position.</p>

<p>It would have been more to the purpose had he produced
his requisitions for food, clothing, comforts, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, and shown
how they were refused or not complied with. At the very time
I gave over part of our own private stores of port wine, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, to
the French Hospitals (for part only of what was given were
Government stores at all), Sir John Hall might have obtained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
out of the large wine store at Balaklava, any amount
of wine he required, by merely asking for it. The simple
statement of this fact would have been a better answer to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr>
Baudens</span><a name="Anchor_20" id="Anchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 20.">[20]</a> than assuming that I could obtain from Government
stores and wine for the French Hospitals which he could not
obtain for his own.</p>

<p>As to his statement about the Nurses, it simply shows
ignorance of the whole matter. Nobody ever contemplated
giving to a Nurse the entire charge of a number of sick in a
Military General Hospital. It is no part of good Hospital
nursing to do so. With proper Orderlies, a Nurse can very
well attend to sixty or seventy sick. We were prevented,
indeed, by the authorities, and by circumstances, from organizing
a proper system of nursing, and were obliged to do all
the good possible in the best possible way. But Sir John
Hall’s method of estimating the efficiency of nursing, by
dividing the number of sick by the number of Nurses, is
simply absurd.</p>

As little reference as possible, no reference at all, if it can be avoided,

The work was done under many difficulties, some inevitable, some
which should have been spared. Things happened among us deeply to be
regretted. Rebellion among some ladies and some nuns, and drunkenness
among some nurses unhappily disgraced our body; minor faults justified
<i>pro tanto</i> the common opinion that the vanity, the gossip, and the insubordination
(which none more despise than those who trade upon them) of
women make them unfit for, and mischievous in the Service, however materially
useful they may be in it. Of all this, the material consequences
might have been spared by some such “General Order” as the above,
which, at least, prevents others from taking advantage and making capital
of such faults.</p>

The Extra Diet Kitchens <em>must</em>, it is necessary to state, be under a
separate roof from the General Kitchens, as long as the present system (or
no-system) of cooking exists. But the sooner it is altered the better.
There should be one kitchen only. But the Nurse should always superintend
the administering of the Diets. She is unquestionably the proper
person, also, to administer the medicines, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> The Orderlies, to be of any
use, must act under the direction of the Head-Nurse and not independently.

To all references which may here be made to Civil Hospitals I should
wish to say, by way of preface:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. That I have always believed and I believe it more and more every
day I live, that what is wrong in hospitals is to be patiently, laboriously,
and, above all, quietly mended by efforts made from within them, if it
pleases God to grant that blessing upon them without which all human
efforts are vain, and not by accusations, investigations, and noise from
without.</p>
<p>2. Also I have always believed, since I knew Hospitals at all, and I
believe it more and more every day I live, that, with all their faults and
shortcomings, which are easily learnt and more easily declaimed against,
our great English hospitals are places in which more is done for the relief
and cure of human misery, or, rather, of that large branch of it arising
from disease, than in any other places in the world. Also that their faults
are not essential to them, but that they may, by God’s blessing on the
patient endeavours of many years, be very much modified.</p>

I would allow each Nurse 1½ pint of porter or ale <i>per diem</i>, or, instead
of the half-pint of porter, 1 <abbr title="ounces">oz.</abbr> of brandy or a wineglass-full of wine, as she
likes best. Most Nurses crave, and rightly, for a luncheon about 9 or
10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and drink some beer then. I would let them take their own time
as to when they drink their day’s allowance. But, while trying to suit each
Nurse’s varying tastes (and in Hospital duty the taste does vary) each
Nurse must keep to one thing, say for a week or month.</p>

Better than a closet is a moveable dresser, only table-height, under
which cleaning can be carried on.</p>
<p>There should be no projections in a ward or recess, which are only
lodgments for flue and dust. The walls of a ward should be even, polished,
impervious.</p>

With regard to children we might look forward to a time when a
school might be formed for the children, if any, of such of Her Majesty’s
Nurses as are widows. This would be an additional bond to the Service
for the mothers. The children, of course, are not to be admitted into
Hospital; and strict rules must be made (and kept to) as to when the
mother should visit them. I do not anticipate that it would be possible
ever to have married women in the Service. And it is hardly necessary to
add, that no women but of unblemished character can ever be admitted.</p>

If it be desired to include some War-Nurses after 40 it would be
better for the Superintendent-General, with the sanction of the Secretary
of State, to take, at first starting, a few past the age, than, on their
account, to alter the age. It stands to reason that, on the formation of the
Staff, approved Nurses of the War-Service should be included in it, for the
sake of the Service.</p>

If the Surgeons are for the men doing it, I would not overpress this
point. But, in the case of weak patients, it requires extra care, and it
would be much better to leave it as the duty of the Nurse. At all events
it will not answer to leave the enema and its administrator unspecified.
The Medical Staff Regulations assign it to the Ward-Masters. It is a
simple thing enough, but one by the careless or ignorant administration of
which many a man (and woman) has been injured for life; and either the
Ward-Master, the Assistant Ward-Master, or the Nurse should be responsible
for it. I should prefer, as above stated, charging the Nurse with it;
but if objected to by the Surgeons, I should at once let them assign it to
whichever Non-commissioned Officer they chose.</p>

The floors are of deal; the length and breadth of the boards depending
on circumstances. Wood skirtings run round the walls, following the
recesses of the window and doors, 2½ <abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> in height and 1½ <abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> in thickness.
The skirtings should have no indents in them, which form convenient
lodgments for dust and take time to clean. A little rim must run round the
top of the skirting, edging the wall. The skirting should thence descend,
unindented, upon the floor. The boards are coloured and prepared, as
follows: A new floor is rubbed over two or three times, with warm linseed-oil
varnish, having some fine yellow-ochre, powdered, in it; then a coat of
“laque-lustre,” a species of French polish, is laid over it, the result being a
reddish-yellow colour, in which the grain and veining of the wood is shown.
If, after being used some time, it begins to look worn, it is rubbed over with
oil and a new coat of polish laid on it; but, as this takes a long time to
dry, it is usual to fill up the worst parts with thin oil-colour, and then to
take the yellow polish and lay it on, in two successive coats, leaving it to dry,
if possible, for twenty-four hours, as it wears the better the firmer and drier
it is. For old boards, that have been much used, considerably more laque-lustre
is required than for new ones.
</p>
<p>
After laying on the laque-lustre it is desirable that the floor should not
be trodden upon for six weeks, and it is also well occasionally, say about
once a week, to polish it, which conduces much to make it serviceable.</p>

Great caution must be used in acting upon this. The Superintendent-General,
or the Superintendents who are responsible to her, order
the service of each Nurse. How far is it just to consider extra dangerous
duties or stations meritorious in the Nurse who does or suffers from them?
Others might have done the same, if so ordered. Others might have
wished for such an order. Or a strong efficient Nurse who, in other
respects, gives anxiety, may render extra useful service on an emergency,
and suffer for it in health: and yet, during her whole service, have given
more anxiety and less satisfaction than others who did not, perhaps had
not the opportunity to, distinguish themselves by any extra useful
service.</p>

The “Superintendent” and “Matron” are here used throughout as

name; although, for reasons before given, “Superintendent” would be the

<h3 title="">I. <span class="smcap">Wages and Prospects of Nurses.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The two
Classes of
Hospital
Nurses.</div>

<p>1. The nurses of the great London hospitals are divided
into two classes: head-nurses or sisters, and nurses or
assistant-nurses. These latter are, generally, subdivided
into day and night-nurses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Head-Nurses
or Sisters.</div>

<p>2. The head-nurses, on an average, receive about £50
a-year and no board, or lower wages and partial board;
the use of one or two rooms, generally unfurnished, and
an allowance of fuel and light. Sometimes uniform outer-clothing
is included. Sometimes two pints of beer daily
are added to the above.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2p" id="Page_2p">[2]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">Nurses or Assistant-Nurses.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Day Nurses.</div>

<p>3. The day-nurses, on an average, receive about 12<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i> a-week
and no board, or lower wages and partial board;
lodging, with the use of some furniture; sometimes an
allowance of fuel and light apart from the use of both in
the wards. Sometimes uniform outer-clothing is added to
the above; sometimes they have also an allowance of one
pint of beer daily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Night Nurses.</div>

<p>4. The night-nurses, on an average, receive about 10<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i> a-week
and no board; lodging, with the use of some furniture;
sometimes an allowance of fuel and light apart from
the use of both in the wards. Sometimes they live in their
own lodgings, near the hospital, receiving the same wages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Retiring
Pensions and
Payments at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Bartholomew’s.</div>

<p>5. I am informed that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew’s Hospital has
no fixed scale of pensions, nor is the term of service defined.
But pensions have been granted to worn-out
sisters of from £15 to £25; as also pensions of smaller
amount to some worn-out nurses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s.</div>

<p>6. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s Hospital, in like manner, has given,
without any fixed rule, pensions to worn-out sisters,
of from £30 to £50. A gift in money has been granted
on the retirement of a sister; and the same has been
done in the case of nurses who may have received injuries
in the discharge of their duties; and in a very few instances
of long and faithful service they have been pensioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At Guy’s
Hospital.</div>

<p>7. Guy’s Hospital for a long time generously provided
for its superannuated sisters, but the plan in practice being
found very objectionable, was a few years since given up,
and the authorities established a Superannuation Fund for
the Servants of the Hospital.</p>

<p>It is compulsory on sisters, optional to nurses, to belong
to it. Each subscriber receives a book containing printed
rules, with tables of rates of ages, payments, and pensions,
and also blank leaves. The subscriber selects the amount
of pension for which she wishes to subscribe. At each
quarterly payment of wages, a proportion is paid into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3p" id="Page_3p">[3]</a></span>
the fund; entered in the subscriber’s book, and properly
attested; the hospital makes a payment of equal
amount into the fund on the subscriber’s account. If
the subscriber die before attaining the age when the
pension begins, the amount paid by the subscriber is disposable
by will, and in case of intestacy reverts to the next
of kin. The pensions, one-half of which are thus purchased
by the subscriber, and one-half presented by the
hospital, vary, if I remember rightly, from £15 to £50.
In February 1857, no nurse subscribed; to which three
remarks apply:&mdash;first, that every good work takes time to
grow; secondly, that not a few of the sisters, having looked
forward to benefiting by the old system of superannuation,
rather grudged their own payments than sought to
induce their nurses to subscribe; thirdly, that many of
the nurses were really unable to make the payment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At the Non-Endowed
Hospitals.</div>

<p>8. The non-endowed hospitals, I believe, but write from
very imperfect information, grant few pensions. Sometimes
they grant a gift of £25 or less to a retiring head-nurse.
Sometimes they employ a head-nurse, become too old for her
work, as an extra and inferior nurse. Sometimes they grant
a worn-out head-nurse an asylum in the incurable ward of
the hospital. I believe the pensions to old nurses are still
fewer than the few to head-nurses. Definite information
could easily be procured. Their funds do not permit such
a diversion from their main and primary object, for which
they are often, as it is, inadequate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At County
Hospitals.</div>

<p>9. Of the wages and prospects of eventual provision of
the nurses of the county hospitals I know nothing; but
understand that the former are lower than, and the latter
as entirely blank as those of the nurses of the non-endowed
London hospitals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4p" id="Page_4p">[4]</a></span></p>
<h3 title="">II. <span class="smcap">Desirability of some further Provision.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Unfitness of
Nurses for any
other work.</div>

<p>1. It may be safely taken for granted as a rule, with few
exceptions, that a thorough hospital nurse can seldom turn
herself to any other business. Her life and work are altogether
peculiar; she acquires a knowledge and habits
which incapacitate her from all ordinary occupations, grows
into fitness for them, and out of fitness for all others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shortness of
their time of
capacity for
Service.</div>

<p>2. No less so, that the time during which a hospital nurse
can work and lay by, is short, compared with the average
duration of other kinds of service. Apart from all excess
of their own, their work and its concomitants wear out
hospital nurses fast. In every large hospital you will see
many women of 40, whom you would suppose 60, and
strength often decays as prematurely as appearance. Well-ventilated
bed-rooms, more sleep, and better food, would
be materially in their favour; but the work can never be
other than one which wears out most constitutions fast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of
Nurses as a
Class.</div>

<p>3. In the London hospitals there are some women of excellent
character and of great efficiency; many the reverse,
in one or both respects; many between the two classes,
who generally end by ranking in the second.</p>

<p>4. To augment the number of the first class, to reduce
the number of the second, to induce the intermediate
eventually to rank with the first, and not with the second,
is the desire of every hospital.</p>

<p>5. It is most important, in all things, in none more than
in hospital matters, to moderate expectations, not to hope
too much from any measure, or set of measures, and to
keep well in view the stern prosaic realities of things.
The hospitals of great towns are not asylums where a few
or many selected patients can be received and petted; but
great receptacles of all sick comers. Their foundations lie
down and deep in the human sin and misery for which
they in part provide, and the traces of their purpose an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5p" id="Page_5p">[5]</a></span>d
nature must ever remain impressed upon them. They are
also schools for the practical education of a great profession,
important to mankind and dangerous to its members.</p>

<p>Hospital nurses are not women attempting or following
“counsels of perfection,” (whatever incorporation of other
elements may be eventually effected), but some of those
many women whom God has ordained to earn their bread
by toil, (and in the large towns of England honest ways of
earning that bread are for women but too scarce and too
overcrowded), and upon whom He has laid the same condition
as on all the souls He has made, to keep the commandments
to enter into life. A very mixed class they must
ever remain: to improve the class, by God’s blessing,
would be to effect a great benefit both to the hospitals and
to these immortal souls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Probable
beneficial
results of a
prospect of
eventual
provision,
depending on
character.</div>

<p>6. Among several things which might be done or tried,
with the view, if it please God to prosper the endeavour,
of eventually improving the class of hospital nurses, the
establishment of some definite prospect of eventual provision,
dependent upon good character, appears very important.</p>

<p>7. It would tend to augment the number of steady
respectable women, who are anxious to keep a good moral
and require a good business character, whose aim it is to
do their duty, to give satisfaction to their superiors, to
keep their places in the same hospital, and eventually to
end their days out of the workhouse.</p>

<p>8. It would tend to diminish the number of ill-conducted
women, who wander from hospital to hospital; whose
wages go in drink or finery, or both; who would be disgusted
at the idea of regularly laying by for their future
support, and who would resent strict investigation into
character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6p" id="Page_6p">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>9. It would tend to induce the intermediate class of
women, who hesitate between good and bad companions,
to incline to the former, and to break off from the latter,
by the favourable result of provident and economical
habits on their actual conduct; and by the effect which
the prospect of a decent support in their age, dependent
upon these habits, would produce.</p>

<h3 title="">III. <span class="smcap">Of what Nature?</span></h3>

<ul>
  <li>1. With regard to kind?</li>

  <li>3. <span class="ditto"> With regard to</span> objects?</li>
</ul>

<div class="sidenote">Kinds of
possible
assistance,
three.</div>

<p>1. With regard to kind.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of possible assistance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pensions.</div>

<p>First. Granting free pensions to efficient and well-conducted
sisters and nurses, under fixed regulations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Facilities for
Saving.</div>

<p>Second. Providing sisters and nurses with a secure
channel of investing their savings; giving them thus the
important assistance of saving their time, trouble, and
expense, in obtaining information as to such secure investment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Additions to
Savings.</div>

<p>Third. Combining, with the second, a certain proportion
of pecuniary aid.</p>

<p>As to the first. It would be wise economy if the
endowed hospitals, who alone could do it, were to grant
such pensions; but whether they are likely to do more
than they do now I am quite ignorant.</p>

<p>Whether our labours in this field should take the
direction of the second or third, is one of the most difficult
questions with reference to a thing which is rife with
difficulties. Towards solving it, I submit that it would
be expedient to employ an able and honest man of business
to procure&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7p" id="Page_7p">[7]</a></span>

</ul>

<div class="sidenote">It is not
possible for
Nurses to
purchase
Annuities out
of their
Savings.</div>

<p>My impression is that it is not possible, in the majority
of cases, for either head-nurses or nurses to purchase
annuities out of their savings.</p>

<p><span class="smrom">I.</span> Their work wears them out comparatively soon.</p>

<p><span class="smrom">II.</span> During its continuance they require to live well
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, to have a sufficiency of good plain food.</p>

<p><span class="smrom">III.</span> They are obliged to put out and pay for either the
whole or nearly the whole of their washing, making, and
mending (and most properly obliged).</p>

<p>Thus apart altogether from the consideration that many
nurses are widows with families, and many others burdened
with helpless or infirm relations, and that, in many
of these cases, the smallest saving out of their wages is
impossible, I doubt whether it can be reasonably expected
that, as a class, hospital nurses should lay by out of their
unassisted savings a provision for their age.<a name="Anchor_21" id="Anchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Persons to be

<p>2. With regard to persons.</p>

<p>Shall the Fund be open exclusively to nurses belonging
to the proposed Institution under Miss Nightingale?</p>

<ul>

  <li>Or extended to those of the London hospitals?</li>

  <li>Or extended to all Hospitals in England?</li>

  <li>Or in the three kingdoms?</li>

  <li>Or in Her Majesty’s dominions in general?</li>

</ul>

<p>Shall the Fund be extended to private and monthly
nurses, including midwives, as well as to hospital-nurses?</p>

<p>I submit that we should consult, on these points, the
authorities of the principal hospitals and a few men of
experience in business besides. (Philanthropists by trade
are, as is well known, the worst possible authorities on
subjects of this kind.)</p>

<p>My impression is that the Fund should certainly be
extended to the three kingdoms. Whether it should be
extended to the empire would depend entirely, in my
judgment, upon the check and scrutiny it would be possible
to exert, on accounts, monies, and certificates, in
distant parts. Upon this men of business should advise.</p>

<p>I think the Fund might eventually be open to private
nurses, midwives, and monthly nurses.<a name="Anchor_22" id="Anchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9p" id="Page_9p">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>I think it perhaps might be open to the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s House
nurses and to those of any institution which does not
provide its servants with a pension. The Nursing Sisters’
Society, I believe, have recently decided on granting their
sisters £20 a-year, after twelve years’ service, a wise,
generous, and, if properly worked, economical measure.
We must avoid the very appearance of disfavour to other
nursing institutions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Objects to be

<p>3. With regard to objects.</p>

<p>Shall the objects be</p>

<ul>
  <li>Material?</li>
  <li>Sanitary?</li>
  <li>Moral?</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">Or shall they be restricted either to the first only or the
first and second? Here, again, I submit that we should
consult hospital authorities and a few men of business
and of experience, as to the feasibility, often a distinct
thing from desirability, of these things.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, and weighing many opposite difficulties,
my impression is strongly in favour of attempting to combine
the three.</p>

<h4 title="">Material objects.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Material

<p>The benefit and provident societies embrace many

<div class="sidenote">Provision after

<p><span class="smrom">I.</span> It appears to me that the main if not the only object

air gets down the throat of almost every nurse, and every
few years or so there is an illness. In many cases a
nurse’s pay stops either when or soon after she becomes a
patient. Some check upon malingering, a thing well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10p" id="Page_10p">[10]</a></span>
known where the name is not, is essential to every hospital.
Of course it presses heaviest upon those who do not
require it. After an illness, before returning into the
wards, the best thing is a short thorough change of air.
Often a severe illness is, and oftener still would be prevented
by a week’s change of air, when the peculiar hospital-languor,
so well known in hospitals, and so indescribable
outside of them, first fairly sets in. The means of change
of air, either before or after illness, are often deficient.
Still, useful as some such provision would be, in many
cases every year, it appears to me so subordinate to the
great object of furnishing these women with some provision
on their superannuation, that if it in the least impeded or
rendered the latter less secure, I should unhesitatingly give
it up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burial
Payments.</div>

<p><span class="smrom">III.</span> With burial payments I think the Fund should have
nothing to do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Payments for
Children.</div>

<p><span class="smrom">IV.</span> As to payments for children, whether on apprenticeship
or at death:&mdash;Upon the whole, after much anxious
thought, I think it undesirable to encourage mothers, as
such. This is one of the many points, as to hospitals,
where theories and experience differ much from each
other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons
against the
last Form of
Aid.</div>

<p>A very large proportion of nurses are mothers, often
widows, with large families, whom they support and put
to service out of their wages, too often eked out by
improper means, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, bribes and petty dishonesty. Many
of these women are moral, sober, industrious, and doubly
anxious to retain their places, on account of their children;
still there are serious embarrassments in employing them.
The wages of hospital nurses are not and never can be
enough to supply a proper support for children, in addition
to the support the mothers ought themselves to have. Consequently
when children are in whole or in part lodged, fed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11p" id="Page_11p">[11]</a></span>
clothed, “educated,” and put to service out of the £50 a-year
of the head-nurse, or out of the 12<i><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></i> a-week of the
nurse, the mother either stints herself of proper food,
proper strong drink (we deal with practice not with
theory), proper warm clothing, for the children’s sake, or
she supplies the deficiency by improper means. If the
nurse cannot afford to live well and abstains from dishonesty,
one of two things infallibly happens&mdash;either she
takes to drink, as the fallacious support of an exhausted
frame, or her strength fails and she breaks down, after a
few months’, sometimes a few years’ struggle. When once
she has taken to drink, one of two things invariably
follows (dishonesty may be presumed to ensue upon, though
it often does not precede habits of drink); she is or becomes
unguarded, and is soon found out, and sinks into
the miserable second and far too numerous class of characterless
hospital nurses, unless drink shortly finishes her;
or, in the other case, she is cautious and guarded&mdash;she
then becomes sly, dishonest, and thoroughly venal; she
extorts gifts and takes bribes from her patients and their
friends&mdash;and the friends of hospital patients, like others,
are of various kinds; she commits constant acts of petty
but often most dangerous dishonesty, possibly remaining
an efficient and clever nurse, sometimes a favourite nurse;
and, so far as regards the crime which has taken the name
of immorality, a moral woman. A certain proportion of
nurses are all the above, excepting drink; for though,
almost without exception, every nurse who drinks takes
bribes, some take bribes and do not drink.</p>

<p>Of course widows and unmarried women who are not
mothers do the above things; but there cannot be a doubt
of the additional and terrible temptation <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12p" id="Page_12p">[12]</a></span>to women
burdened with children, to make money in various ways
out of their patients. Even in the most favourable
cases (and it is to be feared they are few) where the
real good principle of the mother restrains her from
venality, there are still serious objections. The time when
a nurse can go out must necessarily be comparatively
very limited. The time that is enough for the moderate
demands of friendship or acquaintance is miserably insufficient
for the natural yearnings of the mother, especially if
the children are young and helpless. The consequence is
that, either openly or by stealth, she goes to them or
has them brought to her at unallowed times; or, if the
rules of the hospital are lax as to visitors, the children are
perpetually with her: and let it be remembered, that
the head-nurse’s room or rooms are usually at the entrance
of the ward, that being infinitely the best place. It is
difficult to say whether such a practice is most objectionable
as regards the children, or the patients, or the hospital;
and whether it is most objectionable when the
children are young, or adolescent, or grown up. It is
objectionable in all and every one of these cases. And no
less objectionable is it in the case of the assistant-nurse,
who where the rules are lax will receive her children either
in the ward or in the nurses’ kitchen; or where they are
strict, will have the children come about the hospital and
will meet them on the sly.</p>

<p>These things enter immensely, minute as they seem,
into the discipline of wards and of the hospital; and discipline
means a great deal.</p>

<h4 title="">Sanitary objects.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13p" id="Page_13p">[13]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Sanitary
Objects.</div>

<div class="sidenote">To discourage
admission of
women
physically
unfit.</div>

<p>A good many nurses enter hospital service who are
quite unfit for it. Often consumptive and ruptured women,
those suffering from piles or prolapsus, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, present themselves,
are admitted, struggle on for a time, and break
down with or without taking to drink. Undoubtedly, none
but strong healthy women should enter hospital service;
the work will wear them out quite soon enough, and some
of the above complaints are particularly liable to follow
the work.</p>

<p>Here again men of business must advise: the fund ought
to have some efficient though not infallible security as to
the average good health on joining of its members. Life
Insurance rules as to this would be to the point.</p>

<p>Believe me, all these things are important.</p>

<h4 title="">Moral objects.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Moral Objects
attainable.</div>

<p>The most difficult part of a difficult thing, only perhaps
it is at the same time the most important.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Need of
Certificates.</div>

<p><span class="smrom">I.</span> I think that every nurse, before joining the Fund,
should produce a certificate from her matron, stating her
to be a respectable woman. In plain words, for the word
respectable is certainly capable of most wondrous extension,
the certificate should state her to be, in the matron’s
belief, and to the best of her knowledge, a chaste woman,
and should specify whether she be spinster, wife, or widow.
In either of the latter cases, the marriage certificate, and
in the last that of the husband’s death, should accompany
the matron’s.</p>

<p>The matron’s certificate should, I consider, also state
her to be sober; and it would be a question whether it
should not also state her to have served for not less than
a year in the hospital. The vagabond class are a terrible
drag upon the whole order; and some of these might,
from the novelty of the thing, be disposed to join it at
first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14p" id="Page_14p">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smrom">II.</span> An important question would be: Should the
matron’s certificate be renewed every year, and should the
continuance of the nurse’s membership depend on its production?
Men of business must advise as to this: I am
quite unversed as to the details of Provident Societies.</p>

<p>So far as regards the contributor’s own money, the
contract once entered into, must certainly be open to no
further question; unless there has been fraud in the preliminary
statement on which it was based. With regard to
any <em>assistance</em> that may be given the question is different.</p>

<p><span class="smrom">III.</span> The preliminary certificate I do consider very
important, and the subsequent ones, if they can be required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hospitals are
not places for
Penitents.</div>

<p>Until the hospitals are swept of the many mothers who
are not wives, now unhappily to be found in them, no real
good can be done. Hospitals are not, and never can be,
places for “penitents;” and they are about the most dangerous
places where sham penitents can be.</p>

<p>This is precisely what so many people of very different
kinds cannot or will not see; some from ignorance, some
from knowledge, some from the vague, silly, kind feeling
which does such mischief when exerted on practical matters.</p>

<p>Suffer me to submit, without wearying patience by
urging proof,&mdash;</p>

<p>i. That real penitents are wrongly placed in hospital
service, because their admission breaks down the standard
which respectable women who are hospital nurses feel (quite
as keenly as their superiors do in their own concerns)
ought at once to restrain and to protect those engaged in
this very peculiar, very trying, and very exposed work and
life. (I have invariably observed that real penitents are
extra-prudish, and comparatively inefficient, in their hospital
duty. It will at once be perceived how inevitable
this result is.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15p" id="Page_15p">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>ii. That sincere but unconfirmed penitents, in addition
to the above, are most dangerously and improperly placed
in a situation, to them, of very peculiar trial.</p>

<p>iii. That sham penitents, who unhappily abound, are
dangerous everywhere, extra-dangerous in hospitals,
whether to superiors, companions, or patients.</p>

<p>iv. That although the class must ever be a very mixed
one, it is most important to have a standard. Let it be
necessary for every nurse to enter hospital with a good
character, and to leave it on losing it. Deception, hypocrisy,
and successful guilt will be found in hospitals, as
elsewhere; but the class must be raised, and therefore
improved, by requiring the condition of good character;
though guilt may occasionally mask itself behind it.</p>

<p>v. That although, for various and very differing reasons,
the certificates will be not unseldom untrustworthy, still
the same reasoning will apply. Upon the whole the tendency
will be, by requiring the condition of good character,
to improve a class which, containing, as it does,
many well-conducted women, is sadly degraded and contaminated
by many vile ones.</p>

<p>vi. I do not overlook the fact that honest certificates,
especially if annually renewed, might give the matrons
some perplexity, from reasons which need not be enlarged
upon. Still, it seems to me, it would be well worth
trying.</p>

<h3 title="">IV. <span class="smcap">Rules to be followed in giving Assistance.</span></h3>

<p>Lastly. With regard to rules to be followed in giving
assistance of whatever kind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Need of Advice
with a view
above all to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16p" id="Page_16p">[16]</a></span>
Security.</div>

<p>It seems to me most important that we should
obtain the opinions both of hospital authorities and of a
few able men of business, before laying down rules. The
whole matter is so essentially mixed up with the tangible
point of securing that the savings of these poor women
should avail them in their age, that it is urgent to have
sound practical advice as to letting nothing else imperil
this. Security seems the cardinal point of the whole, and
that is a question for men of business to answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suggestions in
detail.</div>

<p>The following suggestions toward obtaining it are offered.</p>

<p>1. Security of invested savings to be the first and main
thing to be secured. Every other object should be subordinate
to this.</p>

<p>2. If we decide upon aiding their savings, let the security
of this aid be the main point. Invest all donations,
annual or not; unless, should any hospitals contribute
annually, it might be fairly considered that those contributions
should be annually used.</p>

<p>3. The aim should be to enable all hospital nurses, of
good character, to provide annuities for themselves, whether
with or without assistance. I think assistance will be
necessary.</p>

<p>4. Also to enable private and monthly nurses, and midwives,
to do the same, but without requiring the certificate
of character, which, not to be a mockery, ought to be an
effectual one; and these persons are not under a fixed
superior.</p>

<p>5. The pensions should, if it be possible, range from
£13 or £15 a-year to £50 a-year: say £13, £20, £30,
£40, £50.</p>

<p>6. Each hospital nurse to produce, before being allowed
to join the Fund, a certificate from her matron of chastity,
general good conduct, and a statement as to her being
unmarried, married, or a widow, also of her having served
in one hospital not less than a year. Also her marriage
certificate, if a wife, and, if a widow, that and the certificate
of her husband’s death. In the event of her marriage
or re-marriage afterwards, the marriage-certificate to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17p" id="Page_17p">[17]</a></span>
produced, and her altered name and the fact of her
marriage duly recorded in the Fund-book. (All this is
important: aliases and fictitious marriages are sadly
common, in this class).</p>

<p>7. If possible the certificate to be produced once a-year,
and, on its failure, the contributor to cease to have a title to
assistance. <em>Assistance</em> in the form of an addition to the
annuity may be made <em>contingent</em>; the annuity which the
premiums provide must be absolute: most of the vices
tend to shorten life, that is, to diminish the number of
annual payments, so that the fund would not be likely to
incur losses through them.</p>

<p>8. Private and monthly nurses, and midwives, to
produce, before being allowed to join the Fund, a certificate
from the Clergyman of the parish, stating his belief
that the subscriber is a respectable woman, unmarried,
married, or a widow; and in the latter cases, marriage and
death certificates. On any after-marriage or re-marriage,
certificate to be produced and altered name registered, on
pain of expulsion from the Fund. I should not attempt
an annual certificate for this migratory and “independent”
class.</p>

<p>9. Each nurse, before being allowed to join the Fund,
to undergo whatever examination is undergone by women
before they are allowed to effect Life Insurances, as to
her being, at the date of joining, a healthy woman.
(Physicians ought to advise here as to inserting provisions
technical enough to be effective).</p>

<p>10. Payments to be made weekly, monthly, quarterly,
or annually, as shall be advised. Amounts to run from
6<i><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></i> or 1<i><abbr title="shilling">s.</abbr></i> a week upwards. For the plan to work, it ought
to allow small payments on an ascending scale.</p>

<p>Many will only be able to make very small payments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18p" id="Page_18p">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Few will be able to make other than small payments.</p>

<p>11. Payments made by a subscriber dying before attaining
pension to be devisable by will, and in case of intestacy,
divided among next of kin.</p>

<p>12. All possible safe curtailment of office expenses.</p>

<p>13. Treasurers, or equivalent civil chiefs, of all hospitals
that subscribe, to be on the committee or council, or by
whatever name the equivalent may be termed.</p>

<h3 title="">V. <span class="smcap">Prospects of eventual Support.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Support by the
Nurses
themselves.</div>

<p>1. I believe that many head-nurses would thoroughly
appreciate and thankfully avail themselves of such a
Fund.</p>

<p>2. I think that many nurses would do the same, and, in
time, many more. Many cannot contribute to it; many
will not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Support from
the Hospitals.</div>

<p>3. What aid the hospitals might be disposed to give I
do not know. I rather think none at first. If the thing
works and works well, I think they would probably contribute.
But it must never be forgotten that, excepting the
endowed hospitals (the financial position of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s I
do not know) the London hospitals find their income
scarcely sufficient, often not sufficient, to meet their
expenditure. They cannot be expected, nor would they
perhaps be justified, to curtail the number of the sick they
relieve, in order to provide for the superannuated nurses
of those sick. It is true, however, that it might enable
them to get better nurses, which is surely economy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Support from
the Public in
general.</div>

<p>4. I do not think that much lasting public interest is
likely to attend the Fund. The interest the public has,
for the last few years, taken in hospitals has been fictitious
and almost mischievous. The public can never really
know what hospitals are, nor is it feasible or desirable
that it should. What eventual good may be done in them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19p" id="Page_19p">[19]</a></span>
must be done quietly and with great patience. What
good may be done among the nurses must be done by
infusing, if it may be, a higher and truer spirit of duty, by
increased discipline and protection, and by ameliorating,
in some material points, among which the aim contemplated
by the Fund ranks very high, a condition which,
to the end of time, must remain severe, rough, dangerous,
and in all senses trying. In the details of all
these things, most especially in all that concerns discipline,
which involves protection, the public, with the best intentions,
will only be an obstacle, and John Bull is sadly
prone to pull up anything he plants or anything he waters,
to see how it grows.</p>

<p>I think anything like appeals to or solicited support from
the public might, in various ways, seriously embarrass the
Superintendent of a very difficult and a very important
though, at the same time, a very humble branch of Her
Majesty’s Service. I should be very anxious to avoid this:
it would be perpetuating the evils of publicity, and sacrificing
the greater good for the lesser.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity of
Advice.</div>

<p>5. In conclusion I again submit that it would be desirable
to ascertain from the hospital authorities above mentioned,
and if possible from three or four able and honest
men accustomed to business, their opinion as to the scope
and details of this plan. In matters of spirit and of discipline
we should probably rely on other judgment; but
these are matters of business; and in which, without
binding ourselves to follow, it seems most important to
obtain and to weigh, the opinions of men long conversant
with business.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Note as to teaching Nursing.</span></h2>

<p>There is, at Madras, an Institution called the Military
Female Orphan Asylum, which trains 200 orphan girls,
daughters of European soldiers. They enter in infancy,
and, as they attain a proper age, they are married to
soldiers or others. There is always an abundance of applicants
for them, and every endeavour is made to train them
to be useful soldiers’ wives. Dr. MacPherson, the excellent
Principal Medical Officer of the Turkish Contingent,
when at Kertch, who is now in charge of this Asylum, was
the person, I believe, who introduced amongst the senior
girls, a system of training, to enable them to officiate as
nurses, an all-important element in their education. Below
is a syllabus of the theoretical branches taught, a practical
knowledge being acquired in the Hospital attached to the
Institution. It would be well if all women underwent a
similar training.</p>

If the sisters and nurses, as a rule, were fed as well as lodged at
all the Hospitals, <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, the class of women would, in a very short time,
be entirely changed; this kind of employment would not then, with the
reduced money payment, be so much an object of desire to widows with
families, particularly if compelled to subscribe to a pension fund, which
should be compulsory.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
